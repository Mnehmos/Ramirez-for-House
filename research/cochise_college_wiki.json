Founded on September 21, 1964, the school has campuses in Douglas and Sierra Vista, and centers in Benson, Fort Huachuca, and Willcox. Cochise College offers associate degrees in art, applied science, business, elementary education, general studies, and science, and over 30 different certificate programs. The college also offers transfer programs for students to transfer to partner universities.\n\n\n== History ==\nCochise College was one of the first community colleges in Arizona when it was founded on September 21, 1964. The college was voted on by the citizens of Cochise County in 1961 and a 1962 bond election resulted in the construction of the Douglas Campus. With the increased growth and interest in secondary education, a second campus was opened in Sierra Vista. The new campus was originally housed in a few temporary buildings on the grounds of Buena High School in the early 1970s but opened a full scale college campus in 1978.\nIn December 2024, James Perey, EdD, was selected to serve as the 12th president of Cochise College, effective February 2025.\nIn 2025, Cochise College was ranked as the top community college in Arizona and 38th in the United States in a 2025 study by financial technology firm SmartAsset, which evaluated 585 institutions.\n\n\n== Campus ==\nCochise College is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission of the North Central Association. The college holds memberships in the Arizona Community College Association, the Council of North Central Two-Year Colleges, the American Association of Community Colleges, the Council for Higher Education Accreditation, the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities and the Association of Community College Trustees.\nThe college also holds Federal Aviation Administration certification for its professional pilot and aviation maintenance programs and Arizona Department of Health Services/Emergency Medical Services certification for its paramedicine and emergency medical technology programs. The nursing program is accredited by the Arizona State Board of Nursing and the Accreditation Commission for Education in Nursing.\nThe Cochise College Library system consists of two branches, the Charles Di Peso Library on the Douglas campus and the Andrea Cracchiolo Library on the Sierra Vista campus. The libraries maintain a collection of over 60,000 books and media items, including DVDs and audiobooks, to support Cochise College curriculum and lifelong learning. The Cochise College Online Library provides access to more than 8,700 magazines and scholarly journals, eBook collections containing over 100,000 titles, and 20,000 plus streaming videos.\nThe school is noted for having its own school-owned airport, built specifically for the college's aviation program.\nIn June 2021, the college administration signed a license agreement with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to allow the U.S. Border Patrol to erect an 80-foot tall, relocatable surveillance tower on the college's Douglas campus. The agreement does not require CBP to compensate the college for use of the site, and does not include an end date for the agreement (although the college can revoke the agreement at any time with 60 days notice). The tower, called a Relocatable Long-Range Surveillance Tower or an Intelligence Relocatable Long-Range Surveillance Tower, is a relocatable version of the Border Patrol's Integrated Fixed Tower (IFT) system. Like the standard IFTs, the tower was manufactured by Elbit Systems of America, the U.S. subsidiary of the Israeli military technology company. It is equipped with electro-optical and infrared cameras as well as radar, and has a maximum effective range of 5-7.5 miles. The tower is located at 31.36339049, -109.682431.\n\n\n== Organization and administration ==\nThe college contains seven campuses and centers, each with its known founding date:\n\n\n== Academics ==\nCochise College offers 49 Undergraduate Associate Degrees in total.\nAssociate of Arts\n\nAssociate of Arts Elementary Education\n\nElementary Education\nAssociate of Business\n\nAssociate of Science\n\nAssociate of General Studies\n\nAssociate of Applied Science\n\n\n== Research ==\n\n\n=== Endowment ===\nAs of June 2019, the Board of Directors has designated $585,071 of net assets without donor restrictions as a general endowment fund to support the mission of the Cochise College Foundation.\n\n\n== Student life ==\n\n\n=== On-Campus Housing ===\nCochise College \u2013 Douglas Campus has traditional residence halls (dorms) and town homes that can house up to 180 residents each semester.
