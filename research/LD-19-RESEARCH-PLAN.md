## EXECUTION PHASES

### Phase 1: Census & Demographics (Week 1)
Pull ACS 5-year estimates for all communities. Build population pyramids. Identify growth/decline trends. This is purely data — mechanical work.

**Key sources:** data.census.gov, Arizona OEO population estimates

### Phase 2: Economic Profiles (Week 1-2)
Top 10 employers per community. County GDP breakdown. Industry sector analysis. Poverty and income mapping. This requires both data pulls and local knowledge verification.

**Key sources:** BLS QCEW, BEA, Arizona Commerce Authority, local Chambers

### Phase 3: Governance Mapping (Week 2)
Every elected official from mayor to school board. Org charts. Term dates. This is the rolodex — who you need to meet, who's an ally, who's entrenched.

**Key sources:** City/town websites, county sites, Arizona League of Cities

### Phase 4: Electoral Deep Dive (Week 2-3)
Precinct-level results going back 3 cycles. Registration trends. Turnout patterns. Identify persuadable precincts. This is the targeting data.

**Key sources:** Secretary of State, County Recorders

### Phase 5: Issues & Narrative (Week 3-4)
Local newspaper archives. Council meeting minutes. What are people actually angry about? What do they want? This is the messaging foundation.

**Key sources:** Local newspapers, meeting minutes, community forums

### Phase 6: Synthesis & Strategy (Week 4)
Compile everything into community-by-community profiles. Identify:
- Where to invest door-knocking time
- Which issues resonate where
- Which communities are persuadable
- Where the votes actually are

---

## OUTPUT DELIVERABLES

1. **Community Profiles** — One markdown file per Tier 1 community with all data points
2. **Economic Dashboard** — Comparative table across all communities
3. **Governance Directory** — Complete elected official database
4. **Electoral Atlas** — Precinct-level maps and trend analysis
5. **Issues Matrix** — Community × Issue heat map
6. **Voter Targeting Model** — Where are the persuadable voters?
7. **Campaign Trail Map** — Optimized canvassing routes by community

---

## IMMEDIATE NEXT ACTIONS

1. Pull Census ACS data for all 5 counties (can be done now)
2. Search for Sierra Vista economic data (this was MISSING from existing profile — it's the largest city in the district!)
3. Build the governance directory starting with county supervisors
4. Pull 2024 precinct-level results from each county recorder
5. Start newspaper archive searches for top local issues

---

## NOTES

- **Critical Gap in Current Profile:** Sierra Vista is barely mentioned despite being the largest population center and home base of all 3 current legislators. This needs to be the #1 research priority.
- **Fort Huachuca is decisive:** The military installation and its ~$3B annual economic impact drives the entire eastern Cochise County economy. Understanding the military voter bloc is essential.
- **The "Three Districts" Problem:** LD-19 is really three different districts stitched together: (1) mining/rural northeast (Graham/Greenlee), (2) military/ranching central (Cochise), (3) suburban/retirement southwest (Vail/Green Valley). Each needs its own messaging.
- **Green Valley's 100+ HOAs** are effectively a parallel government. Understanding their structure is necessary for organizing there.
- **The 33% independents** are the path to victory. Research should identify where they concentrate.
