# Sierra Vista, Arizona -- Campaign Intelligence Profile

**LD-19 Tier 1 Community | Cochise County | Largest City in District**
**Research Date:** 2026-02-06 (Updated 2026-02-06 with ACS 2019-2023, Census 2024 PEP, BLS May 2024, and web research)

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Sierra Vista is the **largest city in Arizona Legislative District 19** with a 2020 Census population of **45,308** and a 2024 PEP estimate of **44,710** (slight decline post-COVID). It is a military-dominated community built around **Fort Huachuca**, the U.S. Army's primary intelligence training installation. The fort's estimated **$2.9 billion annual economic impact** (per Arizona Military Affairs Commission, 2023 report) makes it the single most important economic engine in the district. The city has a younger median age (37.3) than Cochise County overall (44.0), a significant veteran population (**24.2% of adults, 7,505 veterans**), and a diverse racial composition reflective of military communities. Nearly half of all jobs in Sierra Vista are government positions. All three current LD-19 legislators (Sen. David Gowan, Rep. Gail Griffin, Rep. Lupe Diaz) are based in Sierra Vista. The city is the **commercial, cultural, and recreational hub of Cochise County**.

**URGENT VULNERABILITY (2025):** A federal government shutdown beginning October 1, 2025 furloughed **4,000+ civilian workers** at Fort Huachuca, devastating the local economy. Restaurants, utilities, and retail businesses reported double-digit revenue drops. Sulphur Springs Valley Electric Cooperative reports **30% of its residential customers** work at the fort. This crisis demonstrates the existential fragility of the Fort Huachuca dependency and is a live campaign issue.

**Campaign Significance:** This is the single most voter-dense community in LD-19. Any viable campaign must perform well here. The military/veteran population is the defining constituency -- they are educated, employed, and issue-aware. The city's dependence on Fort Huachuca creates a permanent BRAC anxiety that any candidate must address credibly.

## 1. DEMOGRAPHICS & POPULATION

### 1.1 Population

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| **2010 Census Population** | 43,888 | Census SF1 |
| **2020 Census Population** | 45,308 | Census PL 94-171 |
| **ACS 2018-2022 Estimate** | 45,212 | ACS 5-Year DP05 |
| **ACS 2019-2023 Estimate** | 45,203 | ACS 5-Year (Census Reporter/Data USA) |
| **2023 PEP Estimate** | 44,431 | Census Population Estimates Program |
| **2024 PEP Estimate** | 44,710 | Census Population Estimates Program (V2024) |
| **2025 Projected** | ~44,845 | Based on 0.3% annual growth rate |
| **Growth 2010-2020** | +1,420 (+3.2%) | Calculated |
| **Post-2020 Trend** | -958 (-2.1%) from 2020-2023 | Declining post-COVID |
| **Peak Population** | 46,554 (2012) | Already past peak |
| **Growth Rate Trend** | **Declining** | Population peaked 2012, slowly eroding |
| **Sierra Vista Metro Area (broader)** | ~75,000 | City estimates (includes Huachuca City, Hereford, Whetstone, etc.) |
| **Cochise County Total (2020)** | 125,447 | Census |
| **SV as % of County** | ~36% | Calculated |
| **Population Density** | 296.5/sq mi | 152.4 sq mi land area |

**Context:** Sierra Vista's population **peaked in 2012 at 46,554 and has been declining since**. The 2024 estimate (44,710) is below the 2020 Census count (45,308). This is a community that has already passed its peak and shows a trend of decline -- fundamentally tethered to Fort Huachuca staffing levels. Any future BRAC action, civilian workforce reductions, or extended government shutdowns could accelerate this trend. The broader Sierra Vista Area (including adjacent unincorporated communities) is estimated at ~75,000.

### 1.2 Age Distribution

| Age Bracket | Percentage | Est. Count | Notes |
|-------------|-----------|------------|-------|
| **Under 5** | 6.0% | ~2,713 | |
| **5-9** | 6.1% | ~2,758 | |
| **10-14** | 6.9% | ~3,120 | |
| **15-19** | 6.7% | ~3,029 | |
| **Under 18 (total)** | ~22.4% | ~10,128 | Lower than 2000 Census (25.8%) |
| **20-24** | 6.6% | ~2,984 | Military enlistment age |
| **25-34** | 14.6% | ~6,601 | Active duty core demographic |
| **18-34 (approx)** | ~25.7% | ~11,620 | Young military workforce |
| **35-44** | 12.9% | ~5,832 | Mid-career military/civilian |
| **45-54** | 10.1% | ~4,566 | |
| **35-54 (subtotal)** | ~23.0% | ~10,399 | |
| **55-59** | 5.4% | ~2,441 | |
| **60-64** | 5.3% | ~2,396 | |
| **55-64 (subtotal)** | ~10.7% | ~4,837 | |
| **65-74** | 10.3% | ~4,657 | |
| **75-84** | 6.6% | ~2,984 | |
| **85+** | 2.5% | ~1,130 | |
| **65+ (subtotal)** | ~19.5% | ~8,816 | Growing retiree population |
| **Median Age** | **37.3 years** | ACS 2019-2023 | Younger than county (44.0), older than 2000 (32.0); up from 37.0 in ACS 2018-2022 |

**ACS 2019-2023 Age Brackets (Census Reporter):**
| Age Bracket | Percentage | Notes |
|-------------|-----------|-------|
| Under 18 | 22.56% | |
| 18-64 | 55.87% | Working-age population |
| 65+ | 21.58% | Up from 19.5% (ACS 2018-2022) -- accelerating aging trend |

**Campaign Notes:** The median age has risen from 32 (2000) to 37.3 (2023), indicating an aging population as military retirees stay in the area. The 65+ cohort has grown from 19.5% to **21.58%** in just one ACS cycle -- these are largely military retirees who settled here. The 25-34 cohort (14.6%) represents active duty personnel who may not vote locally. The under-18 population has declined proportionally (from 25.8% in 2000 to ~22.6%), meaning fewer young families relative to the past. The high mobility rate (**18.8% moved in past year**) reflects military rotation patterns.

### 1.3 Racial & Ethnic Composition

| Race/Ethnicity | Percentage | Est. Count | Notes |
|----------------|-----------|------------|-------|
| **White alone** | 68.0% | ~30,744 | Down from 73.3% (2000) |
| **Black or African American** | 8.3% | ~3,753 | Military-driven; down from 10.9% (2000) |
| **American Indian/Alaska Native** | 0.6% | ~271 | |
| **Asian** | 3.9% | ~1,763 | Up from 3.6% (2000) |
| **Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander** | 0.8% | ~362 | |
| **Some other race** | 3.2% | ~1,447 | |
| **Two or more races** | 15.2% | ~6,872 | Significantly up from 4.9% (2000) |
| **Hispanic or Latino (any race)** | 11.9% | ~5,380 | Down from 15.8% (2000) per ACS; may vary by methodology |

**Updated ACS 2019-2023 Racial/Ethnic Composition (Census Reporter/Data USA):**

| Race/Ethnicity | Percentage | Est. Count | Notes |
|----------------|-----------|------------|-------|
| **White (Non-Hispanic)** | 58.22% | ~26,300 | Down from 68.0% (ACS 2018-2022 "White alone") |
| **Hispanic or Latino (any race)** | 22.34% | ~10,100 | **UP significantly from 11.9%** (likely methodology change in ACS 2019-2023) |
| **Black or African American** | 6.92% | ~3,100 | Down from 8.3% |
| **Asian** | 3.85% | ~1,700 | Stable |
| **Two or more races** | 7.21% | ~3,300 | Down from 15.2% |
| **Native American** | 0.37% | ~170 | |
| **Pacific Islander** | 0.57% | ~260 | |

**IMPORTANT NOTE ON HISPANIC DATA:** The ACS 2019-2023 reports Hispanic/Latino at **22.3%**, dramatically higher than the ACS 2018-2022 figure of 11.9%. This likely reflects a Census Bureau methodology change in how Hispanic identity is captured (the combined race/ethnicity question), NOT an actual doubling of the Hispanic population. The 22.3% figure is more likely accurate. This significantly changes campaign messaging needs.

**Campaign Notes:** Sierra Vista is notably more racially diverse than rural Arizona communities due to the military. The Black population (6.9%) is far higher than Cochise County (3.8%) or Arizona statewide (~5%). The Hispanic/Latino population at **22.3%** is a significant constituency that cannot be ignored -- Spanish-language outreach is relevant. The lower Hispanic % compared to Cochise County overall (34.0%) still holds but the gap is narrower than previously estimated.

### 1.4 Veterans Population

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| **Civilian veterans (18+)** | **7,505** (+-721) | ACS 2019-2023 (Census Reporter) |
| **Civilian population 18+** | ~31,000 | ACS |
| **Veterans as % of adult population** | **24.2%** (+-2.3%) | Census Reporter |
| **Male veterans** | 6,213 (+-610) | ACS 2019-2023 |
| **Female veterans** | 1,292 (+-279) | ACS 2019-2023 |
| **Comparison: National average** | ~7.1% | VA data |
| **Comparison: Arizona average** | ~8.1% | ACS |
| **SV-Douglas Metro Area rate** | 18.2% (17,297 vets) | The Center Square |

**This is approximately 3.4x the national veteran rate and 3x the state rate.**

**Veteran Service Era Breakdown (Data USA 2023):**
| Service Era | Count | Notes |
|-------------|-------|-------|
| Gulf War (2001-present) | 2,880 | Largest cohort -- GWOT veterans |
| Vietnam Era | 1,711 | Aging population; high VA needs |
| Gulf War (1990-2001) | 1,595 | |
| Other/Peacetime | Remainder | |

**Health Coverage Context:** 10.6% of Sierra Vista residents have military or VA health coverage (vs. ~3% nationally). This underscores the military community's dependence on federal healthcare systems.

**Campaign Notes:** Nearly 1 in 4 adults in Sierra Vista is a veteran. This is THE defining demographic of the city. Any candidate must be credible on military/veteran issues. The veteran community is organized (VFW Post 9972, American Legion Posts 24 and 52, DAV Chapter 26), votes reliably, and cares deeply about: VA healthcare access, Fort Huachuca's future, defense spending, and military family support. Many veterans here are intelligence community professionals -- they are educated, analytically minded, and not easily swayed by empty rhetoric. Note the 1,292 **female veterans** -- a constituency often overlooked in campaign outreach.

### 1.5 Educational Attainment

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| **High school graduate or higher** | **93.3%** | ACS 2019-2023 (Census Reporter) |
| **Less than HS diploma** | **6.7%** | Calculated |
| **HS diploma only** | 22.14% | Census Reporter |
| **Some college, no degree** | 36.18% | Census Reporter -- reflects military "some college" pathway |
| **Bachelor's degree or higher** | **35.0%** | ACS 2019-2023 -- UP from 33.8% (2018-2022) |
| **Graduate/professional degree** | Part of above | Significant due to military officer corps and intel community |
| **Comparison: Arizona statewide** | 27.1% | ACS |
| **Comparison: United States** | 29.3% | ACS |

**Context:** Sierra Vista is one of the most educated communities in southern Arizona. The **35.0% bachelor's+** rate is well above both the state (27.1%) and national (29.3%) averages, reflecting the intelligence community's educational requirements and the military officer corps. The high "some college" rate (36.18%) reflects enlisted personnel with military training credits. The city's website promotes this stat: "More than 31% of Sierra Vista residents hold a Bachelor's Degree or higher." This is an electorate that responds to policy substance, not just slogans.

### 1.6 Household Characteristics

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| **Total households** | 18,592 | ACS 2019-2023 (Census Reporter) |
| **Persons per household** | **2.3** (+-0.1) | ACS 2019-2023 |
| **Married-couple households** | 61.31% | |
| **Female householder, no spouse** | 14.38% | |
| **Male householder, no spouse** | 5.39% | |
| **Non-family households** | 18.92% | |
| **English only at home** | 81.1% | ACS DP02_0113PE |
| **Language other than English** | 18.9% | ACS DP02_0114PE |
| **Speak English less than "very well"** | 4.6% | ACS DP02_0115PE |
| **Other language at home (Census Reporter)** | ~32.6% | Alternate estimate -- higher than state average |
| **Foreign-born residents** | 9.38% (~4,240) | Data USA 2023 |
| **U.S. citizens** | 96.8% | Data USA 2023 |
| **Cars per household** | 2 | Data USA 2023 |
| **Moved in past year** | 18.8% | Census Reporter -- high military turnover |

**Campaign Notes:** The language data shows a range (18.9%-32.6% non-English at home) depending on source. Only 4.6% have limited English proficiency. Campaign materials should be primarily English with Spanish as secondary. The average household size of 2.3 (down from 2.48 in 2000) reflects the growing proportion of retiree and single-person households. The 61.3% married-couple household rate is high, reflecting military family norms. The 18.8% annual mobility rate is far above the national average (~13%), confirming the transient military community.

## 2. ECONOMICS & EMPLOYMENT

### 2.1 Income & Poverty

| Metric | Value | Comparison |
|--------|-------|------------|
| **Median household income** | **$69,783** | ACS 2019-2023 (1.57% decline from prior period) |
| **Average household income** | **$88,378** | ACS 2019-2023 |
| **Per capita income** | **$38,109** (+-$2,070) | ACS 2019-2023 (Census Reporter) -- up from $37,671 |
| **Median family income** | **$88,006** | DP03_0063E |
| **Poverty rate** | **10.9%** (4,673 individuals) | ACS 2019-2023 -- UP from 6.8% |
| **Children in poverty** | 11.68% | ACS 2019-2023 |
| **Seniors in poverty** | 11.37% | ACS 2019-2023 |
| **Unemployment rate** | **5.6%** | ACS 2019-2023 estimate |
| **Health insurance coverage** | 94.1% | Data USA |
| **Uninsured** | 5.88% | Data USA |

**Income Distribution (ACS 2019-2023, Census Reporter):**
| Bracket | Percentage |
|---------|-----------|
| Under $50,000 | 34.67% |
| $50,000-$100,000 | 29.01% |
| $100,000-$200,000 | 30.61% |
| Over $200,000 | 5.71% |

**Campaign Notes:** Sierra Vista's median household income ($69,783) is higher than Cochise County and most of LD-19 (compare: Graham County at $44,876, Greenlee County similar). This reflects the concentration of government and defense contractor salaries. **The poverty rate has risen from 6.8% to 10.9%** in the newer ACS data -- a significant increase that likely reflects post-COVID impacts, furlough effects, and the service-sector workforce struggling while military/contractor salaries remain stable. The **split economy** is stark: 30.6% of households earn $100K-$200K (contractor/officer class) while 34.7% earn under $50K (service sector). This two-tier economy is a key campaign issue.

### 2.2 Housing Market

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| **Median home value (ACS 2019-2023)** | **$239,000** (+-$7,262) | Up 10.7% from $215,900 (ACS 2018-2022) |
| **Median sold price (April 2025)** | **$300,000** | Redfin -- up 4% YoY |
| **Median gross rent** | **$929/month** | Data USA 2023 |
| **Homeownership rate** | **61.5%** | ACS 2019-2023 |
| **Renter-occupied** | 38.46% | Calculated |
| **Total housing units** | 20,351 | Census Reporter |
| **Occupied units** | 91.36% | |
| **Households with mortgage** | 67% | Data USA |
| **Single-unit homes** | 73.34% | Census Reporter |
| **Multi-unit housing** | 21.4% | Census Reporter |
| **Cost of living vs. national** | **7.8% below** national average | AreaVibes |
| **Housing costs vs. national** | **13.8% below** national average | AreaVibes |

**Housing Market Status (2025):** Sierra Vista is a **Seller's Market** -- prices are higher and homes sell faster. Median sale price hit $300,000 in April 2025, up from $239,000 ACS estimate.

**Campaign Notes:** The relatively high renter percentage (38.5%) reflects the military/transient nature of the population. Many active duty families rent rather than buy. Home values have surged from $215,900 to $300,000 sale price in just 2-3 years. While still affordable by Arizona metro standards (7.8% below national average), the rapid appreciation is squeezing service-sector workers, teachers, and first responders. The BAH (Basic Allowance for Housing) for Fort Huachuca directly influences rental markets -- when BAH rates change, landlords adjust rents, squeezing non-military renters. The 8.6% vacancy rate suggests limited inventory. A pending 7,000-home Castle & Cooke development faces legal challenge over water supply adequacy.

### 2.3 Labor Force & Employment

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **In labor force** | 46.2% of population 16+ |
| **Armed Forces** | 9.9% |
| **Civilian labor force** | ~19,019 (as of July 2021) |
| **Civilian employed** | ~18,097 |
| **Unemployment rate (ACS)** | 5.7% |
| **Not in labor force** | 41.2% |

**Note:** The 41.2% "not in labor force" is high but reflects the large retiree population and military dependents. The 9.9% Armed Forces figure reflects active duty personnel counted in the population.

### 2.4 Industry Sector Breakdown (ACS 2018-2022)

| Industry Sector | % of Civilian Workforce | Notes |
|-----------------|------------------------|-------|
| **Public administration** | 19.4% | Government jobs -- Fort Huachuca dominance |
| **Professional, scientific, technical services** | 17.0% | Defense contractors (intelligence, IT, cyber) |
| **Educational services, healthcare, social assistance** | 13.1% | Schools, hospitals |
| **Retail trade** | 11.1% | Commercial hub for county |
| **Arts, entertainment, recreation, accommodation, food services** | 10.3% | Tourism, hospitality |

| Retail Trade | 1,735 | Commercial hub for county |
| Professional, Scientific, Technical | Part of above categories | Defense contractors |
| Accommodation & Food Services | ~1,500 | Tourism, hospitality |

**BLS OEWS May 2024 -- Sierra Vista-Douglas Metro Area:**
| Occupational Group | % of Employment | Notes |
|-------------------|----------------|-------|
| Office & Administrative Support | 11.6% | |
| Sales & Related | 9.1% | |
| Food Preparation & Serving | 8.8% | |
| Protective Service | Highly concentrated | Much higher than national average |
| Computer & Mathematical | Highly concentrated | Reflects intel/cyber mission |
| Construction & Extraction | Highly concentrated | |

**Notable BLS Finding:** Detectives and criminal investigators employed at **32.2x the national rate** in Sierra Vista-Douglas MSA. Correctional officers at **6.3x** the national average. This reflects Fort Huachuca intelligence training, Border Patrol, and the federal law enforcement presence.

**Campaign Notes:** The combined public administration (19.4%) and professional/technical services (17.0%) sectors account for **36.4% of all civilian employment**. This is the Fort Huachuca economy. When you add military personnel (9.9% of population), the defense sector dominates the local economy. "Nearly half of all jobs in Sierra Vista are government jobs." The total employed population was 15,945 in 2023 -- a 4.53% decline from the prior year, reflecting the population decline trend. Average commute is only 17.5 minutes. 10.7% work from home.

### 2.5 Occupation Distribution (from Wikipedia/City data)

The largest occupational categories in Sierra Vista are:
1. Management, business, science, and arts occupations
2. Service occupations
3. Sales and office occupations
4. Production, transportation, and material moving
5. Natural resources, construction, and maintenance

| 8 | **Cochise College** | Education | 300-500 | 3,782 enrolled students |
| 9 | **Canyon Vista Medical Center** | Healthcare | 200-400 | 100-bed acute care hospital |
| 10 | **Cochise County** | Government | 800+ | County government operations |
| 11 | **City of Sierra Vista** | Government | 300-500 | Municipal workforce |
| 12 | **Walmart** | Retail | 200-300 | Major retail employer |
| 13 | **Wick Communications** | Media | 100-200 | HQ in Sierra Vista; 27 newspapers in 11 states |
| 14 | **Lawley Automotive Group** | Auto dealer | 100-200 | Local auto dealer |
| 15 | **Various retail (The Mall at Sierra Vista, etc.)** | Retail/Service | Hundreds | 400,000 sq ft mall + commercial strips |

**Note:** Employee counts are estimates based on available data and typical employer sizes. Fort Huachuca's direct and indirect employment dwarfs all other employers combined.

### 2.7 Fort Huachuca Economic Impact

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| **Annual economic impact (2023 MAC report)** | **$2.9 billion** | Arizona Military Affairs Commission estimate |
| **Annual economic impact (alt. estimate)** | **$2.4 billion** | Cochise County Economic Development figure |
| **Total installation employment** | **~8,800** | 2023 MAC report; roughly half civilian |
| **Active duty soldiers** | ~6,000 (2018: ~2,300 assigned + trainees) | Fluctuates with training cycles |
| **Military family members** | ~7,400 | |
| **Civilian DOD employees** | **~4,000+** | Those furloughed in Oct 2025 shutdown |
| **Civilian employees (other agencies on post)** | ~400 | |
| **Trainees on any given day** | ~2,700 | 8,000+ trained annually |
| **On-post weekday population** | 18,000+ | Soldiers, civilians, contractors, trainees |
| **Defense contractor firms** | Dozens | Raytheon, GDIT, Northrop Grumman, Amentum, Agile Defense, etc. |
| **% of SV residents working at Fort** | ~20% (1 in 5) | 2023 MAC report; Cronkite News |
| **% of Sierra Vista jobs that are government** | ~50% | Per Wikipedia/city data |
| **Local sales tax generated** | **$23.2 million/year** | Fort-connected spending |
| **Local property tax generated** | **$17.3 million/year** | |

**BRAC Vulnerability:** Fort Huachuca has survived all BRAC rounds (1988, 1991, 1993, 1995, 2005). In 2005, it was ranked #21 of top 99 installations by military value -- well above the cut line -- and actually **gained missions**. The fort's unique intelligence training and cybersecurity mission makes consolidation elsewhere difficult. However:
- Fort Huachuca lost **2,350 FTE jobs between 2009 and 2014**
- The Army 2020 Force Structure Realignment threatened 2,700 more jobs
- The **October 2025 government shutdown** furloughed 4,000+ civilians, devastating local economy
- Any future BRAC round remains an **existential threat** to the region
- The Arizona congressional delegation has historically been bipartisan in defending Fort Huachuca

### 2.8 Economic Development

- Sierra Vista Economic Development Foundation is active
- The city positions itself as an "intelligence community hub" -- the three fastest-growing DOD missions (UAS, military intelligence, cybersecurity) are all centered at Fort Huachuca
- University of Arizona College of Applied Science & Technology is a designated IC-CAE (Intelligence Community Center of Academic Excellence)
- Growing cybersecurity and IT sector tied to Fort Huachuca missions
- Tourism (birding, Ramsey Canyon, astronomy) provides supplementary economy
- Proximity to Mexico border creates some cross-border commercial activity
- The Mall at Sierra Vista (400,000 sq ft) serves as the regional commercial center
- **BlackStar Orbital:** City signed a Letter of Intent (2025) for BlackStar Orbital to occupy a portion of the Sierra Vista Municipal Airport -- potential aerospace/space sector diversification
- **Cost of living advantage:** 7.8% below national average; housing 13.8% below; used as a draw for employers and retirees

**Economic Vulnerabilities:**
1. **Fort Huachuca dependency:** 50%+ of jobs connected to the installation. Any BRAC, budget sequestration, or government shutdown devastates the economy
2. **Government shutdown exposure:** Oct 2025 shutdown furloughed 4,000+ civilians; local businesses reported double-digit revenue drops
3. **Water scarcity:** Could limit future growth and development; 7,000-home Castle & Cooke project faces water supply legal challenge
4. **Declining population:** City peaked in 2012 (46,554) and is slowly losing residents
5. **Limited economic diversity:** Retail/service sector is low-wage; manufacturing nearly absent
6. **Border instability:** Fluctuations in migration patterns affect law enforcement resources and public perception

### 3.2 Cochise County Board of Supervisors

| District | Supervisor | Party | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|-------|
| **District 1** | **Tom Crosby** | R | Re-elected Nov 2024; western/Sierra Vista area |
| **District 2** | **Kathleen Gomez** | R | Elected Nov 2024; replaced Ann English (D); central/SV area |
| **District 3** | **Frank Antenori** | R | Elected Nov 2024 in a landslide; replaced Peggy Judd (R); eastern portion |

**All-Republican Board (2025):** The Nov 2024 election resulted in a clean GOP sweep. The previous board had included Democrat Ann English (District 2). All three seats are now Republican.

**County Sheriff:** **Mark Dannels** -- Cochise County Sheriff. Member of Fraternal Order of Police, U.S. DHS Advisory Council, National Sheriffs Association (Border Security Chairman). High-profile on border security issues.

**Cochise County Controversies:** The county gained national attention in 2022 when the Board of Supervisors (under Judd and Crosby) initially refused to certify election results. Supervisor Tom Crosby faces a pending trial related to the delayed certification. The county may again challenge state election laws ahead of 2026.

### 3.3 School Districts

**Sierra Vista Unified School District (SVUSD)**

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Community served** | 48,526 (per NCES) |
| **Total enrollment (2024)** | **4,461 students** | 11 schools |
| **Full-time teachers (2023-2024)** | 229.20 | |
| **Student-teacher ratio** | 19.46 | |
| **Median household income (district area)** | $59,450 |
| **Families below poverty level** | 22.4% |

**Schools:**
- **Buena High School** -- the city's sole traditional high school (also serves Fort Huachuca dependents)
- **Joyce Clark Middle School**
- **6 Elementary Schools:** Bella Vista, Carmichael, Huachuca Mountain, Pueblo Del Sol, Town & Country, Village Meadows

**Academic Performance (AZ Report Cards):**
- 40% of elementary students at/above proficient in reading
- 36% of elementary students at/above proficient in math
- **Below state averages** -- an area of concern for military families considering the community

**District Demographics (2024):**
| Race/Ethnicity | % |
|----------------|---|
| White | 42.3% |
| Hispanic/Latino | **41.1%** |
| Black | 5.1% |
| Asian/Pacific Islander | 1.5% |
| American Indian/Alaska Native | 0.6% |
| Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander | 0.8% |
| Two or More Races | remainder |
| **Minority enrollment** | **60%** |

**NOTE:** The SVUSD student body is dramatically more Hispanic (41.1%) than the city's overall population (22.3%), reflecting that Hispanic families may have more school-age children per household. The school district is a **majority-minority** district.

**Fort Huachuca Accommodation Schools** (on-post):
- Colonel Johnston Elementary School (K-2)
- General Myer Elementary School (3-5)
- Colonel Smith Middle School (6-8)
- High school students attend Buena High School (SVUSD)

**Campaign Notes:** The SVUSD poverty rate (22.4%) is notably higher than the city's ACS poverty rate (6.8%), suggesting the district boundary includes lower-income surrounding areas. Education issues (school quality, teacher retention, funding) will resonate. Having only one high school creates a unifying community institution -- Buena High School is where "everyone" goes.

### 3.4 Law Enforcement

| Agency | Jurisdiction |
|--------|-------------|
| **Sierra Vista Police Department (SVPD)** | City limits | CALEA-accredited; 911 N Coronado Ln; (520) 452-7500 |

| USAICoE CSM | Command Sergeant Major Warren Robinson | |
| NETCOM CSM | Command Sergeant Major Richard Knott | |

### 4.4 Historical Significance

- Founded 1877 to counter Chiricahua Apache threat and secure Mexico border
- **Buffalo Soldiers:** Home of the 10th Cavalry Regiment (1913-1933), composed of African American soldiers
- WWII: Quarters for 25,000+ soldiers; 92nd and 93rd Infantry Divisions (African-American) trained here
- Korean War: Reactivated 1951 for engineer training; closed again 1953; reopened 1954
- Post-1954: Pivoted to electronic warfare and signals intelligence
- 1967: Became HQ of U.S. Army Strategic Communications Command
- 1976: Declared National Historic Landmark
- Current era: Army's primary intelligence and cyber training center
- DEA aerostat (Tethered Aerostat Radar System) for drug interdiction from Mexico

### 4.5 BRAC History & Status

Fort Huachuca has survived all BRAC rounds. Key points:
- The installation's unique intelligence training mission makes it difficult to consolidate elsewhere
- 2005 BRAC round actually added missions to Fort Huachuca
- NETCOM was realigned in 2014 as subordinate to U.S. Army Cyber Command
- Growing cybersecurity mission potentially strengthens the fort's BRAC resilience
- However, any future BRAC round remains an existential threat to the region
- The Arizona congressional delegation has historically been bipartisan in defending Fort Huachuca

**Campaign Position Required:** Any LD-19 candidate must have a clear, credible position on protecting Fort Huachuca. State-level actions include: supporting water rights (fort needs water), maintaining favorable tax environment for contractors, supporting infrastructure to/from the fort, and coordinating with federal delegation on defense authorization.

### 4.6 Workforce Summary

| Category | Approximate Count |
|----------|------------------|
| Total installation employment | **~8,800** | 2023 MAC report |
| Active duty soldiers | ~6,000 (incl. ~2,700 trainees) | |
| Military family members | ~7,400 | |
| Civilian DOD employees | **~4,000+** | Half of 8,800 total per MAC report |
| Civilian employees (other agencies) | ~400 | |
| Defense contractors (estimated) | 3,000-5,000+ | Raytheon, GDIT, Northrop Grumman, Amentum, Agile Defense |
| On-post weekday total | 18,000+ | |
| **Total Fort-connected population** | **~22,000-25,000** | |
| % of SV residents at Fort | ~20% (1 in 5) | |

This means roughly **half the population of Sierra Vista** is directly connected to Fort Huachuca. The installation trains **8,000+ personnel annually** in intelligence, cybersecurity, and UAS operations.

## 5. KEY ISSUES & PAIN POINTS

### 5.1 Water

**This is the single most contentious local issue in Sierra Vista.**

- The Upper San Pedro River Basin / Sierra Vista subwatershed is the critical water source
- USGS reports: **Water levels are declining** in areas along the San Pedro River near Sierra Vista. Unsustainable conditions exist in the northern subwatershed
- **Massive overdraft:** Approximately **4,000 acre-feet annually** drawn beyond replenishment from the sub-watershed feeding Fort Huachuca and the conservation area
- A USGS monitoring well on the San Pedro River has **dried up entirely**
- Water levels have fallen below **court-set minimums** per a Water Adjudication Court ruling
- Fort Huachuca is under fire for high water use -- described as "killing the San Pedro River" by environmental groups
- **Castle & Cooke development (7,000 homes):** Governor Katie Hobbs reviewed whether to revoke the 100-year water supply designation for this massive development. In June 2025, the Center for Biological Diversity filed a lawsuit challenging **water supply designations for 55 subdivisions** in the Fort Huachuca/Sierra Vista area
- **Political flashpoint:** A "Water 101" presentation by State Rep. Gail Griffin (Aug 2025) in Sierra Vista drew protests when it was limited to Republican precinct committee members, excluding the public
- The City, Friends of the San Pedro River, and Borderlands Restoration Network received a **$1.5 million grant** for drought resiliency
- Cochise County is NOT in an Active Management Area (AMA) for groundwater -- unlike Phoenix and Tucson -- creating a regulatory gap
- **Campaign angle:** Water is existential -- for the fort, the environment, and residents. The water issue splits coalitions: developers want growth, environmentalists want conservation, the military needs water for operations, and residents need drinking water. A candidate who can speak to sustainable water management earns credibility across ALL constituencies. Rep. Griffin's exclusionary approach to the Water 101 meeting creates an opening for a more inclusive candidate.

### 5.2 Healthcare Access

| Facility | Type | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|
| **Canyon Vista Medical Center (CVMC)** | Community hospital | 100-bed acute care hospital; 177,000 sq ft; 5700 E Hwy 90. Joint Commission accredited. Level III Trauma Center, Arizona Cardiac Receiving Center. Founded 1963 as Western Baptist Osteopathic Hospital. |
| **Raymond W. Bliss Army Health Center** | Military hospital | On Fort Huachuca; serves active duty and eligible dependents/retirees |
| **Cochise County VA Clinic** | Veterans Affairs outpatient | 157 N Coronado Dr, SV 85635. Mon-Fri 8am-4:30pm. Part of Southern Arizona VA Health Care System (10 locations). Services: primary care, audiology, physical/occupational therapy, women's health, MST care, homeless veteran services |
| **CVMC Emergency Room** | Emergency | Level III Trauma Unit with two helicopter pads |
| **Carter Imaging/Lab/Outpatient Surgery** | Outpatient | CVMC system satellite |
| **Casa de la Paz** | Hospice | CVMC system hospice services |

**CVMC Services Detail:** Emergency Level III Trauma, women and children's (birthing suites, Level I NICU), intensive/progressive/acute care, bone and joint institute, sports medicine, cardiac catheterization lab, surgical services, outpatient surgery center, adult psychiatric unit, 3D mammography, rehabilitation. Gold Seal of Approval for hip/knee replacement.

- Specialty care often requires travel to **Tucson (~75 miles)** -- a major quality-of-life issue
- The Bliss Army Health Center is limited to TRICARE-eligible populations
- **VA Clinic notable:** Free care for veterans who experienced military sexual trauma (MST) -- no service-connected disability rating required
- **Regional health concern:** Elevated childhood leukemia cases were reported 1995-2003 (13 diagnosed children). CDC investigated in 2004 and 2006; no environmental cause found, but elevated tungsten, styrene, and PCB-52 levels were noted.
- **Campaign angle:** Healthcare access (especially specialty care) is a legitimate rural healthcare issue. VA clinic presence is positive but limited -- the nearest full VA hospital is in Tucson. 10.6% of residents rely on military/VA coverage. Telemedicine expansion, specialist recruitment, and mental health services are key needs.

### 5.3 Housing & Cost of Living

- Median home value: $215,900 -- moderate by AZ standards but rising
- Median rent: $1,080/month -- significant for service sector workers
- 38.5% renter-occupied -- high due to military transience
- The Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) for Fort Huachuca influences the local rental market
- When BAH rates change, landlords adjust rents accordingly, which can squeeze non-military renters
- **Campaign angle:** Housing affordability for non-military workers (teachers, healthcare workers, retail) is a growing concern. The military BAH distortion of the rental market is a nuanced local issue.

### 5.4 Infrastructure

- Two state highways (SR 90 and SR 92) are the primary road connections
- No interstate access -- I-10 is ~30 miles north via SR 90
- Sierra Vista Municipal Airport has no commercial flights
- Public transit (Vista Transit) is limited
- Broadband connectivity has improved but rural surrounding areas lag
- **Campaign angle:** Transportation infrastructure and broadband access are quality-of-life issues, especially for connecting to Tucson economic opportunities.

### 5.5 Border Proximity

- 15 miles from Mexico border; nearest port of entry is Naco (24 miles)
- Fort Huachuca operates DEA-funded aerostat radar for drug interdiction
- Border Patrol has significant presence in the region
- Cochise County has been a focal point in immigration debates
- **Recent incidents:** Increase in car crashes caused by human smugglers ("load drivers") in the Sierra Vista area, some injuring bystanders
- **Street releases:** A 2023 surge in border crossings led to "street releases" of migrants in Arizona without pre-arranged transportation. Sheriff Dannels and local mayors held a press conference in Sierra Vista
- **Political context:** Cochise County voters strongly supported Arizona's 2024 border security ballot proposition. The county is a key border-security constituency
- **Campaign nuance:** This is a sensitive issue. The military community is generally law-and-order oriented but also pragmatic. Many in the intelligence community understand border security in nuanced terms. Over-the-top immigration rhetoric may play well in some areas of LD-19 but could backfire with the educated military demographic in Sierra Vista. The community has been described as "relatively unscathed" compared to other border communities, but the issue remains top-of-mind.

### 5.6 Local Controversies & Historical Issues

- **Fry enclave:** The unincorporated enclave of Fry within Sierra Vista has a complex racial history. The original incorporation of Sierra Vista in 1956 deliberately excluded Fry's mixed-race community. This history, while largely historical, informs the community's racial dynamics.
- **Childhood leukemia cluster (1995-2003):** Though CDC investigations were inconclusive, this remains in community memory.
- **Environmental vs. military tensions:** Environmentalists periodically challenge Fort Huachuca's water usage, creating tension between conservation and economic/defense interests.
- **Water 101 controversy (Aug 2025):** State Rep. Gail Griffin held a closed water meeting in Sierra Vista limited to Republican precinct committee members, excluding the general public. Protesters gathered outside. This created a public perception of exclusionary governance on the most critical local issue.
- **Castle & Cooke water lawsuit (2024-2025):** The Center for Biological Diversity sued to challenge water supply designations for the 7,000-home development AND 55 other subdivisions. Governor Hobbs reviewing water adequacy determination.
- **Cochise County election certification controversy (2022):** Supervisors Judd and Crosby initially refused to certify the 2022 election. Crosby faces a pending trial. The county may again challenge state election laws ahead of 2026.
- **October 2025 government shutdown:** 4,000+ civilian workers furloughed at Fort Huachuca. Local businesses allowed customers to eat on credit. Utility companies offered payment extensions. This is a **live, visceral economic wound**.
- **Fort Huachuca furloughed workers may not receive backpay** -- a particularly painful aspect of the shutdown.
- **First McDonald's drive-thru:** A point of local pride -- opened in Sierra Vista in 1975 to serve soldiers who couldn't leave their vehicles in uniform.

## 7. CAMPAIGN STRATEGY NOTES

### 7.1 The Military Voter

The defining challenge and opportunity in Sierra Vista is the military/veteran voter:
- **Educated:** 35.0% bachelor's+ (above state average of 27.1%)
- **Employed:** Median household income $69,783 -- but poverty risen to 10.9%
- **Organized:** VFW Post 9972 (one of nation's largest), American Legion Posts 24 & 52, DAV Chapter 26
- **Issue-aware:** Intelligence community professionals who analyze information for a living
- **Politically diverse:** While military communities lean R, the diversity of the force (6.9% Black, 22.3% Hispanic, 3.9% Asian) means no monolithic voting bloc
- **Key concerns:** Fort Huachuca's future (especially after Oct 2025 furloughs), VA healthcare, water security, housing costs, school quality, government shutdown protection
- **Female veterans:** 1,292 women veterans -- an often-overlooked constituency with specific healthcare and VA needs

### 7.2 Messaging Framework

**DO:**
- Lead with Fort Huachuca protection and defense economy -- especially after the Oct 2025 furlough crisis
- Emphasize veteran healthcare access and VA services (10.6% of residents on military/VA coverage)
- Address water sustainability as a bipartisan necessity -- the San Pedro River crisis is existential
- Highlight education quality (Cochise College #1 in AZ) but acknowledge SVUSD performance gaps
- Speak to housing affordability -- $300K median sale price is squeezing service workers
- Respect military service and intelligence community professionalism
- Acknowledge the two-tier economy: 30.6% of HH earn $100K+ while 34.7% earn under $50K
- Engage the 22.3% Hispanic population with bilingual outreach
- Reach female veterans (1,292) with targeted messaging on women's VA healthcare

**DON'T:**
- Take anti-military-spending positions
- Dismiss border security concerns (15 miles from Mexico)
- Use partisan culture war framing -- this audience is pragmatic
- Ignore the BRAC issue -- it is the sword hanging over the community
- Assume all military voters are single-issue social conservatives
- Hold closed-door meetings on water issues (contrast with Griffin's Water 101 exclusion)
- Ignore the government shutdown wound -- people are still recovering

### 7.3 Voter Contact Strategy

- ~45,000 population = ~30,000+ voting-age residents
- High veteran percentage means high civic engagement propensity
- The single high school (Buena High) and limited number of community gathering spots concentrates canvassing
- Veterans Memorial Park events provide natural touchpoints
- Cochise College campus for younger voter engagement
- VFW and American Legion posts for veteran outreach
- Sierra Vista Herald and KTAN (News/Talk) for earned media
