## Cochise County Governance

### County Board of Supervisors

| District | Name | Party | Area Covered |
|----------|------|-------|-------------|
| District 1 | Tom Crosby | R | Sierra Vista, Huachuca City, Fort Huachuca, Hereford |
| District 2 | **Kathleen Gomez** | **R** | Bisbee, Douglas, Naco, Palominas — **NEW (2025): replaced Ann English (D), who did not seek re-election** |
| District 3 | **Frank Antenori** | **R** | Willcox, Benson, St. David, Tombstone, Bowie, Dragoon, Pearce/Sunsites, Elfrida — **NEW (2025): replaced Frank Antenori (R)** |

**CRITICAL POLITICAL NOTE (UPDATED 2025):** The Cochise County BOS is now **ALL REPUBLICAN**. Ann English (D-District 2) — the lone Democratic voice — did not seek re-election and was replaced by Kathleen Gomez (R). Frank Antenori (R-District 3) was replaced by Frank Antenori (R), a former state legislator known for hardline conservative positions. **There are now zero natural Democratic allies on the Cochise County Board.** Frank Antenori covers most of the communities in this report.

### Cochise County Sheriff

- **Mark Dannels** (R) — Long-serving sheriff, strong border enforcement stance, high visibility in the county. Dannels has been vocal on border security and has cultivated a law-and-order brand. He is well-known and respected across political lines for community engagement, though his politics are firmly conservative.

## 1. BENSON

**Incorporated City | Cochise County | "Gateway to Kartchner Caverns"**

### Demographics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Population (2020 Census)** | 5,355 |
| **Population (ACS 2023 est.)** | ~5,400 |
| **Population change 2010-2020** | +4.9% (was 5,105 in 2010) |
| **Median age** | 52.7 |
| **% Under 18** | 18.5% |
| **% 65 and over** | 30.2% |
| **White alone** | 74.3% |
| **Hispanic/Latino** | 33.8% |
| **Black/African American** | 1.5% |
| **American Indian** | 1.8% |
| **Two or more races** | 4.2% |
| **Median household income** | $38,547 |
| **Per capita income** | $22,891 |
| **Poverty rate** | 18.4% |
| **Median home value** | $132,600 |
| **Homeownership rate** | 70.1% |
| **Veterans** | ~15% of adult population |
| **Educational attainment (HS+)** | 85.2% |
| **Educational attainment (BA+)** | 16.3% |

**Key demographic takeaway:** Benson is aging (median age 52.7), relatively low-income, and has a significant Hispanic population (33.8%). The poverty rate (18.4%) is substantially above the national average. Nearly a third of residents are 65+. This is a community where Social Security, Medicare, and retirement security messaging should land hard.

### Economics

**Major employers/economic drivers:**
- **Kartchner Caverns State Park** — Arizona's premier limestone cave, located ~9 miles south of Benson. Generates ~200,000+ visitors/year. The park itself employs ~40-60 people directly, but the tourism spillover (hotels, restaurants, gas stations) is Benson's economic lifeline
- **Union Pacific Railroad** — Historic employer. Benson was founded as a railroad town in 1880. Freight operations continue but employment has declined significantly from historical levels
- **Apache Powder Company** — Industrial explosives manufacturer south of town. One of the larger private employers (~50-80 workers)
- **Benson Hospital** — Small critical access hospital, important employer and the nearest facility for surrounding communities
- **Cochise County government** — County road maintenance, administration
- **Retail/service sector** — Safeway, Dollar General, gas stations along I-10. Benson functions as a supply stop for travelers and surrounding rural communities
- **Arizona State Prison Complex - Tucson** (nearby) — Some prison system employment
- **Vigneto** — A massive master-planned community development (~28,000 homes at full buildout) south of Benson by El Dorado Holdings/Benson Holding Company. This is potentially transformative but also deeply controversial

**Vigneto Development — Critical Campaign Issue:**
- Approved for up to 28,000 homes on ~12,300 acres south of Benson
- Would transform Benson from a ~5,000 person town into a metro area larger than Sierra Vista
- Water supply is the central controversy — developer claims adequate groundwater, but critics (including many Benson/St. David residents) fear catastrophic aquifer depletion
- Development pace has been slow due to economic conditions, but infrastructure planning is underway
- This is a wedge issue: pro-growth residents see jobs and tax base; anti-growth residents see water depletion and loss of rural character

**Railroad history:**
- Benson was the Southern Pacific Railroad junction point connecting Tucson to Tombstone during the silver boom (1880s)
- The city's identity is rooted in rail. The San Pedro Valley Railroad station is on the National Register of Historic Places
- Modern freight still passes through but does not generate significant local employment

### Governance

| Position | Name | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|
| **Mayor** | **Joe Konrad** | Confirmed as of 2025 |
| **City Council** | 6 members | Council-Manager form of government |
| **City Manager** | Position filled | Day-to-day operations |
| **Police Chief** | Benson PD, small force | ~12-15 sworn officers |
| **State House Rep** | Lupe Diaz (R) | Diaz is FROM Benson — this is his home turf |

**Critical political note:** **Lupe Diaz (R), one of the two current LD-19 House incumbents, is from Benson.** Any campaign activity in Benson is directly in the incumbent's backyard. This means (a) Diaz has strong local relationships, but also (b) if the campaign can compete here, it sends a powerful signal. Benson residents know Diaz personally — any weaknesses in his service will be known.

**RECALL CRISIS (2026):** Four of six Benson council members face **recall elections on May 19, 2026** over an aluminum recycling plant controversy. The crisis includes allegations of a **fake Facebook profile** used to support the plant. This is significant political chaos in Diaz's hometown — it creates an opportunity for outside attention and signals that local governance is failing. The recall could depress Republican turnout or create openings for reform-minded voters.

### Key Issues

1. **WATER (Tier 1 Issue)**
   - The San Pedro River aquifer serves Benson, St. David, and the broader San Pedro Valley
   - The Vigneto development's water demand is the single most contentious local issue
   - The San Pedro Riparian National Conservation Area (managed by BLM) depends on the same aquifer — environmental groups are highly engaged
   - Benson is NOT in an Active Management Area under Arizona groundwater law, meaning pumping is essentially unregulated
   - Campaign message alignment: **Family Well Protection Act** is directly relevant

2. **Healthcare Access**
   - Benson Hospital (now part of TMC Healthcare/Banner system) is a small critical access facility
   - Limited specialty care — residents drive 45 min to Tucson or 30 min to Sierra Vista for most specialists
   - Ambulance response times in surrounding areas (St. David, Pomerene) can be 20-30 minutes

3. **Economic Stagnation**
   - Median household income of $38,547 is well below state and national averages
   - Young people leave for Tucson or Phoenix — limited career opportunities
   - Kartchner Caverns tourism helps but is seasonal and low-wage

4. **Border Proximity**
   - Benson is ~30 miles from the border. The I-10 Border Patrol checkpoint east of town is a constant reminder
   - Residents report seeing migrant groups passing through rural areas
   - This is a top-of-mind issue, but the framing varies: some residents see it as a security crisis, others see it as a humanitarian issue, most see it as "someone else's problem that we have to deal with"

5. **Broadband/Infrastructure**
   - I-10 corridor has decent connectivity, but surrounding areas are underserved
   - Cell service is spotty outside town limits
   - Road maintenance is a chronic concern (county roads serving rural residences)

### Electoral Profile

- **Political lean: Solid Republican, but not monolithic**
- Benson precinct (general area) went approximately 65-70% Trump in 2020 and 2024
- Hispanic population (33.8%) is a potential Democratic base, but many Hispanic residents in this area are culturally conservative
- The Diaz factor: having a local Republican incumbent means the GOP infrastructure is strong here
- **Voter registration estimate:** ~60% R, ~22% D, ~18% I/Other
- **Turnout pattern:** Higher in presidential years, drops significantly in midterms/state-only elections
- **Persuadable segments:** Retirees concerned about water and healthcare; Hispanic families concerned about cost of living; anti-Vigneto residents who feel ignored by Republican leadership

## 2. WILLCOX

**Incorporated City | Cochise County | "Cattle Capital of Arizona" | Wine Country**

### Demographics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Population (2020 Census)** | 3,757 |
| **Population (ACS 2023 est.)** | ~3,600 |
| **Population change 2010-2020** | +2.3% (was 3,672 in 2010) |
| **Median age** | 38.5 |
| **% Under 18** | 26.4% |
| **% 65 and over** | 20.1% |
| **White alone** | 68.2% |
| **Hispanic/Latino** | 59.8% |
| **Black/African American** | 0.8% |
| **American Indian** | 2.1% |
| **Two or more races** | 3.5% |
| **Median household income** | $33,281 |
| **Per capita income** | $17,430 |
| **Poverty rate** | 24.3% |
| **Median home value** | $89,200 |
| **Homeownership rate** | 59.4% |
| **Educational attainment (HS+)** | 73.2% |
| **Educational attainment (BA+)** | 12.1% |

**Key demographic takeaway:** Willcox is majority-Hispanic (59.8%), younger than most communities in this report (median age 38.5), and economically distressed (poverty rate 24.3%, median income $33,281). This is one of the poorest incorporated communities in LD-19. The low educational attainment (only 73.2% HS graduates) reflects the agricultural economy's reliance on manual labor. This community should be highly receptive to economic justice messaging.

### Economics

**Major employers/economic drivers:**

1. **Agriculture (dominant sector)**
   - **Cattle ranching** — Willcox has long branded itself "Cattle Capital of Arizona." The surrounding Sulphur Springs Valley is prime rangeland. Cattle auctions at the Willcox Livestock Auction are an institution
   - **Wine grapes** — This is the big story. The Willcox AVA (American Viticultural Area) was established in 2016. **Approximately 74% of Arizona's wine grapes are grown in the Willcox area.** The wine industry has grown from almost nothing in the 2000s to ~40+ vineyards/tasting rooms
   - **Pistachio farming** — Arizona's pistachio industry is concentrated in the Sulphur Springs Valley. Several large operations (500+ acres) are active. Pistachios are water-intensive, which creates tension with other water users
   - **Row crops** — Chile peppers, corn, hay, and other irrigated crops
   - **Apple orchards** — The annual Apple Annie's fall season and Willcox Apple Festival draw thousands of visitors

2. **Wine Industry Detail**
   - Willcox AVA: ~1,500+ acres of planted wine grapes
   - Key varieties: Malvasia Bianca, Syrah, Grenache, Mourvèdre, Tempranillo, Viognier
   - ~40+ tasting rooms in the Willcox/Kansas Settlement area
   - Wine tourism growing rapidly — estimated $30-50M annual economic impact to the region
   - Arizona Vignerons Alliance advocates for the industry
   - **Water tension:** Wine grapes need ~3 acre-feet per acre; vineyards are competing with pistachio orchards (which need more) for the same declining aquifer

3. **Retail/services** — Safeway, Walmart (the closest Walmart for a huge geographic area), fast food
4. **Cochise College — Willcox Center** — Satellite campus offering workforce training
5. **Mining support services** — Some Willcox residents commute to mining operations

**The Water Crisis in the Willcox Basin:**
- The Willcox Groundwater Basin is **NOT** in an Active Management Area
- The water table has been dropping at alarming rates — **2-5 feet per year** in some areas
- Large-scale pistachio and nut farming operations have dramatically increased water consumption
- Earth fissures have appeared in the Sulphur Springs Valley due to land subsidence from over-pumping
- In 2022-2023, the Arizona Legislature debated (and partially passed) measures to study the basin, but meaningful regulation remains absent
- **This is THE issue for Willcox.** Every resident knows about it. The debate is between agricultural property rights ("I should be able to pump what's under my land") and collective resource management
- Campaign alignment: **Family Well Protection Act** is directly applicable, but messaging must be careful — many residents are themselves agricultural water users

### Governance

| Position | Name | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|
| **Mayor** | **Gregory Hancock** | Confirmed as of 2025 (replaced Mike Laws) |
| **City Council** | 6 members | Council-Manager form |
| **Police Chief** | Willcox PD | Very small force, ~6-8 sworn |
| **Fire** | Willcox Fire Department | Volunteer + career mix |

**Local newspaper:** Willcox Range News — Small weekly, covers agriculture, school events, city council. Worth monitoring for issue pulse.

### Key Issues

1. **WATER (Tier 1+ Issue — arguably THE single biggest issue in Willcox)**
   - Declining aquifer in the Willcox Basin
   - Earth fissures from subsidence
   - Tension between large agricultural operations (pistachio farms, dairies) and residential/small-farm water users
   - No Active Management Area designation despite decades of calls for one
   - State legislature has been slow to act — Republican leadership has generally sided with property-rights framing over regulation
   - **This is where the Family Well Protection Act message hits hardest**

2. **Agricultural Economy Vulnerability**
   - Climate change is making ranching harder (drought, heat stress on cattle)
   - The wine industry is growing but depends entirely on groundwater
   - If the aquifer fails, Willcox's entire agricultural economy collapses

3. **Poverty and Cost of Living**
   - 24.3% poverty rate is among the highest in the district
   - Limited job opportunities beyond agriculture and retail
   - Young people leave — population is essentially stagnant
   - Housing is cheap ($89K median home value) but incomes are very low

4. **Healthcare**
   - No hospital in Willcox — the nearest is Northern Cochise Community Hospital in Willcox (small, limited services) or Benson Hospital, or Sierra Vista
   - Specialty care requires a drive to Tucson (80 miles) or Sierra Vista (60 miles)
   - Ambulance service is stretched thin across huge geographic area

5. **Education**
   - Low educational attainment reflects economic conditions
   - Willcox USD struggles with teacher recruitment — rural, low pay
   - Cochise College presence helps but limited offerings

6. **Border**
   - Willcox is ~60 miles from the border
   - Less directly impacted than Hereford/Sierra Vista, but agricultural labor depends heavily on the immigration system
   - Many agricultural workers are immigrants — immigration enforcement directly impacts the labor supply

### Electoral Profile

- **Political lean: Swing potential — more competitive than most LD-19 communities**
- The 59.8% Hispanic population makes this one of the most potentially competitive communities in LD-19
- However, rural Hispanic voters in agricultural areas trend more conservative than urban Hispanic voters
- 2020 precinct data showed Willcox area approximately 55-60% Trump, 38-42% Biden — closer than most of the district
- **Voter registration estimate:** ~48% R, ~30% D, ~22% I/Other
- **This is one of the top persuadable communities in the smaller Cochise towns**
- Agricultural workers and low-income families respond to economic messaging
- Water is a bipartisan anger point
- **The wine industry creates a small but politically engaged entrepreneurial class that may be more moderate**

## 3. TOMBSTONE

**Incorporated City | Cochise County | "The Town Too Tough to Die"**

### Demographics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Population (2020 Census)** | 1,220 |
| **Population (ACS 2023 est.)** | ~1,300 |
| **Population change 2010-2020** | -7.1% (was 1,314 in 2010; bounced back slightly) |
| **Median age** | 60.8 |
| **% Under 18** | 10.2% |
| **% 65 and over** | 39.4% |
| **White alone** | 83.7% |
| **Hispanic/Latino** | 22.3% |
| **Black/African American** | 0.5% |
| **American Indian** | 1.2% |
| **Median household income** | $31,563 |
| **Per capita income** | $21,874 |
| **Poverty rate** | 19.7% |
| **Median home value** | $108,900 |
| **Homeownership rate** | 68.8% |

**Key demographic takeaway:** Tombstone is VERY old (median age 60.8, nearly 40% are 65+), VERY white (83.7%), and low-income. Only 10% are under 18 — this is not a family community, it is a retirement/tourism community. The economy is entirely dependent on tourism.

### Economics

**Tourism economics (the entire economy):**
- **Tombstone's economy IS tourism.** The O.K. Corral, Boothill Graveyard, Bird Cage Theatre, Tombstone Courthouse State Historic Park, and the daily gunfight reenactments are the economic engine
- Estimated 400,000-500,000 visitors per year
- Tourism supports restaurants, hotels/B&Bs, gift shops, saloons, tour operators
- The Tombstone Epitaph (newspaper, est. 1880) still publishes and is itself a tourist attraction
- **Helldorado Days** (October) is the premier annual event, drawing tens of thousands
- Most businesses on Allen Street (the main tourist strip) are tourism-dependent
- Employment is seasonal — peak in spring/fall, slow in summer heat and winter

**Economic vulnerabilities:**
- Near-total dependence on a single industry (tourism)
- COVID-19 devastated the town — tourism dropped dramatically in 2020-2021
- Competition from other Old West attractions
- The town's infrastructure is aging and expensive to maintain for such a small tax base
- Water supply is a chronic issue — the original Tombstone water system (Huachuca Mountains pipeline) is historic but costly

### Governance

| Position | Name | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|
| **Mayor** | **Dusty Escapule** | Confirmed as of 2025 — long-time local figure |
| **City Council** | 6 members | Tombstone politics are notoriously contentious |
| **City Clerk/Manager** | Various | High turnover historically |
| **Marshal (Police)** | Tombstone Marshal's Office | Very small — 2-3 officers |

**Tombstone governance note:** Tombstone city politics are famously fractious. Council meetings can be contentious, with factions fighting over tourism management, city finances, and personality conflicts. There have been multiple recalls, lawsuits between council members, and public feuds. The town's small size means politics are intensely personal.

### Key Issues

1. **Tourism vs. Authenticity**
   - Constant tension between commercialization and historical preservation
   - Some residents want more development (hotels, attractions) to increase revenue
   - Others want to preserve the "authentic" character that draws visitors
   - The National Historic Landmark designation constrains development

2. **Water**
   - Tombstone's water supply comes from springs in the Huachuca Mountains via a 23-mile pipeline built in the 1880s
   - In 2011, the Monument Fire damaged the watershed. Tombstone's attempts to repair its pipeline in the Miller Peak Wilderness created a legal battle with the U.S. Forest Service over motorized equipment in wilderness areas
   - This became a cause célèbre for states' rights advocates — Tombstone v. United States was litigated for years
   - Water remains precarious. The pipeline is old, the source is limited, and the town has no realistic alternative

3. **Economic Fragility**
   - One bad tourism season (wildfire smoke, pandemic, recession) can devastate the town budget
   - The tax base is tiny — roughly 500 households supporting a full city government
   - Infrastructure costs are disproportionate to the population

4. **Healthcare**
   - No medical facilities in Tombstone
   - Nearest hospital: Sierra Vista (~25 miles)
   - For a population that is 40% seniors, this is a serious quality-of-life issue
   - Ambulance response time from Sierra Vista or Tombstone's volunteer EMS is a concern

5. **Housing**
   - Short-term vacation rentals (Airbnb) compete with long-term housing
   - Limited housing stock in the historic district

### Electoral Profile

- **Political lean: Strongly Republican**
- Tombstone is one of the most conservative communities in Cochise County
- The older, whiter demographic combined with the gun culture/Old West identity creates a firmly R environment
- 2020 precinct data: approximately 70-75% Trump
- **Voter registration estimate:** ~65% R, ~15% D, ~20% I/Other
- **Not a persuadable community for a Democratic candidate in terms of winning the precinct**
- However, water and healthcare issues can generate respect/attention even from Republican voters
- **Strategy: Show up, listen, don't expect to win but don't write off. Presence matters.**

## 4. HUACHUCA CITY

**Incorporated Town | Cochise County | Military-Adjacent Community**

### Demographics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Population (2020 Census)** | 1,748 |
| **Population (ACS 2023 est.)** | ~1,850 |
| **Population change 2010-2020** | +5.5% (was 1,657 in 2010) |
| **Median age** | 37.2 |
| **% Under 18** | 25.3% |
| **% 65 and over** | 15.8% |
| **White alone** | 68.5% |
| **Hispanic/Latino** | 39.2% |
| **Black/African American** | 6.8% |
| **American Indian** | 1.5% |
| **Two or more races** | 8.2% |
| **Median household income** | $40,125 |
| **Per capita income** | $19,850 |
| **Poverty rate** | 17.2% |
| **Median home value** | $105,000 |
| **Homeownership rate** | 62.5% |
| **Veterans** | ~25% of adult population |

**Key demographic takeaway:** Huachuca City is the YOUNGEST community in this report (median age 37.2) and the most racially diverse (39.2% Hispanic, 6.8% Black — the Black population reflects military demographics from Fort Huachuca). It has a high veteran population (~25%). This is a working-class military town.

### Economics

**Major employers/economic drivers:**
- **Fort Huachuca** — The U.S. Army installation is THE economic driver for all of eastern Cochise County. Fort Huachuca is the Army's primary intelligence training center (home of the U.S. Army Intelligence Center of Excellence and U.S. Army Network Enterprise Technology Command). The base employs ~7,000 military, ~5,000 civilian, and ~7,000+ contractors
- **Defense contractors** — Many Huachuca City residents work for defense contractors: General Dynamics, Raytheon (now RTX), Northrop Grumman, Leidos, CACI, ManTech
- **Military retirees** — Many veterans retire in the area for the low cost of living and proximity to base services (PX, commissary, medical)
- **Retail/service** — Limited; residents shop in Sierra Vista (5 miles away)

**Economic note:** Huachuca City is essentially a bedroom community for Fort Huachuca and Sierra Vista. It exists because housing is cheaper than in Sierra Vista proper. The town has very limited commercial development of its own.

### Governance

| Position | Name | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|
| **Mayor** | **Johann R. Wallace** | Confirmed as of 2025 (not Johann Holm as previously listed) |
| **Town Council** | 6 members — **all female except mayor** | Council-Manager form. Notable: Huachuca City has an all-female council (except the mayor), a rare distinction. |
| **Town Manager** | Position filled | Small staff |
| **Police** | Huachuca City PD | Very small |

**Governance note:** Huachuca City's town government is minimal. Most services come from Cochise County or Sierra Vista. The town's budget is tiny and heavily dependent on state-shared revenue and sales tax from the few commercial businesses along Highway 90.

### Key Issues

1. **Fort Huachuca Dependency**
   - BRAC (Base Realignment and Closure) risk is the existential threat
   - Every BRAC round since 2005 has created anxiety. If Fort Huachuca were to close or significantly downsize, Huachuca City would essentially cease to function
   - The base has survived previous rounds partly due to its intelligence mission and clear weather for UAV testing
   - Campaign message: Supporting military families and base stability is essential here

2. **Housing Affordability**
   - Even with relatively low home values ($105K median), military families on E-4/E-5 pay find housing challenging
   - Rental stock is limited and often substandard
   - Some absentee landlords take advantage of the military rental market (BAH-driven pricing)
   - **Worker Housing Freedom Act** may resonate here

3. **Infrastructure**
   - Roads in Huachuca City are in notably poor condition
   - The town lacks resources to maintain infrastructure
   - Stormwater drainage is inadequate — monsoon flooding is a recurring problem
   - Limited commercial development means limited tax base for improvements

4. **Healthcare**
   - The Raymond W. Bliss Army Health Center at Fort Huachuca serves military families
   - Civilian residents rely on Canyon Vista Medical Center in Sierra Vista
   - For non-military residents without easy base access, healthcare is a drive away

5. **Education**
   - Students attend Sierra Vista USD schools — the schools are decent but the commute adds burden
   - Some families choose Buena High School or Sierra Vista schools

### Electoral Profile

- **Political lean: Republican, but more moderate than rural communities**
- Military communities tend to be Republican but less rigidly so than rural agricultural areas
- The diversity of the military demographic (39.2% Hispanic, 6.8% Black) means the community is less monolithically conservative
- 2020 precinct data: approximately 60-65% Trump
- **Voter registration estimate:** ~55% R, ~25% D, ~20% I/Other
- **Moderate persuadability** — military families respond to practical governance issues (infrastructure, schools, housing)
- The veteran population cares about VA access, military benefits, and base stability more than culture-war issues
- **Strategy: Show genuine support for military families. The Worker Housing Freedom Act and healthcare access messaging can resonate.**

## 5. ST. DAVID

**Unincorporated Community (CDP) | Cochise County | Farming Community**

### Demographics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Population (2020 Census)** | 1,668 (CDP) |
| **Population (ACS est.)** | ~1,700 |
| **Median age** | 55.3 |
| **% 65 and over** | ~30% |
| **White alone** | ~82% |
| **Hispanic/Latino** | ~23% |
| **Median household income** | ~$38,000 |
| **Poverty rate** | ~16% |

**Note:** As an unincorporated CDP, Census data for St. David is less granular than for incorporated cities. Estimates should be treated as approximate.

### Character and Economics

St. David is a quiet agricultural community strung along the San Pedro River between Benson and Tombstone. Its defining features:

- **Artesian wells** — St. David was historically known for artesian wells where groundwater pressure pushed water to the surface without pumping. This natural feature attracted Mormon settlers in the 1870s-1880s. Many of these artesian wells have ceased flowing due to regional aquifer depletion — this is an emotionally powerful symbol of water loss
- **The Holy Trinity Monastery** — A Benedictine monastery that is a local landmark and retreat center
- **Farming** — Small-scale agriculture: hay, pecans, some livestock. The San Pedro River provides riparian habitat but is increasingly intermittent
- **Retirement** — Many residents are retirees attracted by the rural setting and cheap land

**Economy:** There is essentially no commercial district. Residents drive to Benson (10 minutes) or Sierra Vista (30 minutes) for shopping. The economy is residential — people live here, they work elsewhere.

### Governance

- **No municipal government** — Cochise County Board of Supervisors (District 3, Frank Antenori) is the governing body
- **Cochise County Sheriff** provides law enforcement
- **Benson Unified School District #9** serves St. David students (St. David School provides K-8; students attend Benson High School)
- **San Pedro Valley Fire District** provides fire/EMS
- Community decisions are made informally through civic groups and school board participation

### Key Issues

1. **WATER (the defining issue)**
   - The artesian wells that once defined St. David are going dry — this is not abstract, it is visible and personal
   - The San Pedro River's flow has decreased dramatically
   - The Vigneto development near Benson threatens to further deplete the shared aquifer
   - Residents feel powerless because the area is not in an Active Management Area
   - **This is perhaps the single best community in LD-19 for the Family Well Protection Act message.** The loss of artesian wells is a tangible, visible, emotionally resonant example of unregulated groundwater pumping destroying a community's heritage

2. **Rural Isolation**
   - No commercial services
   - Limited broadband
   - Long response times for emergency services
   - Dependent on Benson for healthcare, shopping, and services

3. **Agricultural Preservation**
   - Small farmers worry about being squeezed out by development pressure and water depletion
   - The rural character of St. David is valued by residents but threatens to be changed by growth radiating from Benson/Vigneto

### Electoral Profile

- **Political lean: Conservative**
- The Mormon heritage community tends toward Republican voting
- 2020: approximately 65-70% Trump
- Small population means few total votes, but showing up in St. David shows rural communities are not invisible
- **Water messaging is universally resonant here regardless of party affiliation**

## 6. HEREFORD

**Unincorporated Community | Cochise County | Rural, Near Border**

### Demographics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Population (2020 Census area)** | ~3,000-3,500 (spread across Hereford CDP and surrounding area) |
| **Median age** | ~50 |
| **White alone** | ~75% |
| **Hispanic/Latino** | ~35% |
| **Median household income** | ~$45,000-50,000 |
| **Poverty rate** | ~12-15% |

**Note:** Hereford is unincorporated with loosely defined boundaries. Census data is approximate. The Hereford CDP had ~700 population in the 2010 Census, but the broader Hereford area (including Palominas and Nicksville) is larger.

### Character and Economics

Hereford sits along the San Pedro River approximately 10 miles south of Sierra Vista and about 15 miles north of the Mexican border at Naco. Character:

- **Rural residential** — Large lots, horse properties, small ranches
- **Military-adjacent** — Many residents are military retirees or active-duty families from Fort Huachuca seeking rural living
- **Border proximity** — Hereford is one of the closest LD-19 communities to the border. Residents see Border Patrol constantly and have direct experience with border-related activity (smuggling routes, migrant groups)
- **San Pedro Riparian National Conservation Area** — This BLM-managed preserve follows the San Pedro River through the Hereford area. It is one of the most important riparian habitats in the Southwest and draws birders/naturalists from around the world

**Economy:** Primarily residential. Some ranching. Residents work in Sierra Vista or Fort Huachuca. The Hereford Natural Foods (now closed/changed) and a few small businesses are the extent of commercial activity.

### Governance

- **Cochise County Board of Supervisors, District 1** (Tom Crosby, R)
- **Cochise County Sheriff** for law enforcement
- **Palominas Fire District** for fire/EMS
- **Palominas Elementary School District** — K-8; students attend Tombstone or Sierra Vista high schools

### Key Issues

1. **Border Security**
   - This is THE issue in Hereford. The community is directly on smuggling routes
   - Residents report finding migrant groups on their property, cut fences, water containers
   - Border Patrol response times are a concern
   - Some residents have invested in personal security measures (cameras, fencing, firearms)
   - **Any candidate must acknowledge border concerns here with specificity and empathy — dismissing or minimizing them will be fatal to credibility**

2. **Water**
   - The San Pedro River aquifer is the water supply
   - Same depletion concerns as Benson/St. David
   - The San Pedro Riparian NCA depends on maintaining river flow — environmental vs. residential vs. agricultural use tensions

3. **Rural Services**
   - Very limited EMS/fire response
   - No commercial services — everything requires a drive to Sierra Vista
   - Road maintenance on county roads is intermittent

4. **Property Rights**
   - Strong libertarian/property-rights ethos
   - Residents chose Hereford for privacy and independence
   - Government regulation is generally viewed skeptically

### Electoral Profile

- **Political lean: Strongly Republican**
- Border proximity drives conservative voting
- Military retiree population reinforces Republican lean
- 2020: approximately 70%+ Trump
- **Voter registration estimate:** ~65% R, ~18% D, ~17% I/Other
- **Not a target for persuasion, but presence matters**
- **Strategy: Show up, listen to border concerns with genuine engagement, demonstrate you take security seriously. You won't win this precinct but you can reduce the margin and build respect.**

## 7. PEARCE/SUNSITES

**Unincorporated Communities (CDPs) | Cochise County | Retirement Community**

### Demographics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Population (2020, combined area)** | ~3,500-4,000 |
| **Sunsites CDP (2020)** | ~2,600 |
| **Pearce CDP (2020)** | ~800 |
| **Median age** | ~62 |
| **% 65 and over** | ~45% |
| **White alone** | ~88% |
| **Hispanic/Latino** | ~15% |
| **Median household income** | ~$30,000-35,000 |
| **Poverty rate** | ~18-22% |

**Key demographic takeaway:** Pearce/Sunsites is the most retirement-heavy community in this report. Nearly half of residents are 65+. It is overwhelmingly white and low-income. Many residents are on fixed incomes (Social Security, small pensions).

### Character and Economics

Pearce and Sunsites are adjacent communities in the Sulphur Springs Valley, about 25 miles southeast of Willcox.

- **Sunsites** was developed in the 1960s-70s as a retirement community — a "sun belt" subdivision marketed to retirees from the Midwest and Northeast. Streets were platted on a grid across the desert. Many lots were sold sight-unseen by mail. The development includes a community center, golf course (often struggling financially), and basic amenities
- **Pearce** is the historic community, named for the miner who discovered gold in the nearby Dragoon Mountains in the 1890s. The Pearce General Store is a local landmark
- **Cochise Stronghold** is nearby — a historic Apache stronghold in the Dragoon Mountains used by Cochise during the Apache Wars. It is now a recreation area

**Economy:**
- Almost entirely dependent on retirement income and transfer payments
- No significant employers
- A few small businesses (general store, RV parks, small restaurants)
- Nearest shopping: Willcox (25 miles) or Sierra Vista (55 miles)

### Governance

- **Cochise County Board of Supervisors, District 3** (Frank Antenori)
- **Cochise County Sheriff**
- **Pearce Elementary School District** — Very small K-8 district
- **Sunsites-Pearce Fire District** — Volunteer fire/EMS
- **Sunsites Community Association** — Manages the golf course, community center; quasi-governance role

### Key Issues

1. **Healthcare Access (Critical)**
   - No medical facilities anywhere nearby
   - Nearest hospital: Sierra Vista (55+ miles) or Willcox (25 miles, limited services)
   - For a population that is 45% elderly, this is potentially life-threatening
   - Ambulance response times can exceed 30 minutes
   - **This is where the Rural Healthcare Access Act message is most urgent**
   - Telehealth requires broadband, which is limited

2. **Broadband/Infrastructure**
   - Internet service is extremely limited — satellite or very slow DSL
   - Cell service is spotty
   - This isolation compounds every other problem (healthcare telehealth, economic opportunity, education)

3. **Water**
   - Same Willcox Basin aquifer depletion issues
   - Many residents are on private wells
   - Water table decline threatens the viability of these wells

4. **Fixed Income Pressures**
   - Property taxes, insurance costs, utilities — all rising
   - Social Security cost-of-living adjustments don't keep pace
   - Grocery shopping requires a 50+ mile round trip — gas costs matter

5. **Isolation/Services**
   - Nearest real grocery store: Willcox or Sierra Vista
   - Limited transportation options for those who can't drive
   - Social isolation is a real health concern for elderly residents

### Electoral Profile

- **Political lean: Very Republican**
- Older, white, rural retirement community = firmly Republican
- 2020: approximately 70-75% Trump
- **Voter registration estimate:** ~65% R, ~15% D, ~20% I/Other
- **Not a persuasion target overall, BUT:**
  - Healthcare messaging can land even with Republican voters when their lived experience matches
  - Social Security / Medicare protection is bipartisan among retirees
  - **If the campaign frames issues as "protecting what you've earned" rather than progressive ideology, there is listening potential**

## 8. BOWIE

**Unincorporated Community | Cochise County | Railroad Community**

### Demographics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Population (2020 area)** | ~400-500 (Bowie CDP) |
| **Median age** | ~48 |
| **White alone** | ~65% |
| **Hispanic/Latino** | ~45% |
| **American Indian** | ~5% (proximity to San Carlos Apache) |
| **Median household income** | ~$28,000-32,000 |
| **Poverty rate** | ~25-30% |

### Character and Economics

Bowie is a tiny community on I-10 in the far northeastern corner of Cochise County, near the Graham County line.

- **Railroad heritage** — Bowie was established as a railroad stop on the Southern Pacific line. It was also the site of historic Fort Bowie, which guarded Apache Pass during the Indian Wars (Fort Bowie National Historic Site is nearby)
- **Fort Bowie National Historic Site** — Managed by the National Park Service. A 3-mile trail leads to the fort ruins. Draws modest tourism (~15,000-20,000 visitors/year)
- **Chiricahua National Monument** is accessible from Bowie via Arizona Route 186 — "Wonderland of Rocks." A significant tourist attraction (~60,000 visitors/year)
- **Agriculture** — Small-scale ranching in the surrounding San Simon Valley

**Economy:** Bowie is deeply impoverished. The few businesses include a gas station, a small school, and a post office. Most employed residents commute to Willcox, Safford, or even farther. Bowie Unified School District #14 is one of the smallest in Arizona (~100 students).

### Governance

- **Cochise County Board of Supervisors, District 3** (Frank Antenori)
- **Cochise County Sheriff**
- **Bowie Unified School District #14** — K-12, extremely small
- **Bowie Volunteer Fire Department**

### Key Issues

1. **Extreme Poverty** — Bowie is one of the poorest communities in LD-19. Median household income around $30K with poverty rates approaching 30%.

2. **Isolation** — 60+ miles from a hospital, 30 miles from a supermarket. Limited internet, limited cell service. This is true rural isolation.

3. **School Viability** — With ~100 students, the Bowie school district faces constant financial pressure. Small Arizona districts struggle to meet state requirements.

4. **Water** — Private wells, no municipal system. San Simon Valley aquifer conditions vary.

5. **Infrastructure** — County road maintenance, lack of services.

### Electoral Profile

- **Political lean: Conservative but population is so small that individual votes matter**
- 2020: approximately 65-70% Trump
- Total voters: probably fewer than 200 active voters
- **The entire community could be covered in a single day of door-knocking**
- Showing up in Bowie sends a message: "I came to a community of 400 people because you matter"
- This is not a vote-count play. It is a respect play.

## 9. DRAGOON

**Unincorporated Community | Cochise County | Rural, Amerind Foundation**

### Demographics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Population** | ~200-300 (extremely small, no official CDP in 2020) |
| **Character** | Scattered rural residences |
| **Median age** | Unknown (too small for reliable estimates) |
| **Predominant demographic** | White, older, rural |

### Character and Economics

Dragoon is a tiny community along the railroad line between Benson and Willcox, nestled against the Dragoon Mountains.

- **Amerind Museum and Foundation** — THE reason anyone knows Dragoon exists. Founded in 1937 by amateur archaeologist William S. Fulton, the Amerind Foundation houses one of the finest collections of Native American art and artifacts in the Southwest. The museum draws researchers and visitors and hosts cultural events. It is a nationally significant institution in an improbable location.
- **Dragoon Mountains** — The range includes Cochise Stronghold (east side) and significant hiking/climbing. The landscape is iconic Chiricahua Apache country.
- **Railroad** — Union Pacific freight passes through. No passenger service.
- **Texas Canyon** — The dramatic boulder formations along I-10 at the Dragoon exit are a well-known Arizona landmark.

**Economy:** There is essentially no economy. The Amerind Museum is the only employer of any note (small staff, ~5-10 employees). Residents are retirees, artists, or people seeking extreme rural isolation.

### Governance

- **Cochise County Board of Supervisors, District 3** (Frank Antenori)
- **Cochise County Sheriff**
- **School: Served by Benson USD or Cochise district**
- No fire district — relies on mutual aid

### Key Issues

1. **Isolation** — Even more isolated than Bowie. No services of any kind.
2. **Cultural Preservation** — The Amerind Foundation's survival and relevance
3. **Fire Risk** — Wildfire in the Dragoon Mountains is a real threat. No nearby fire response.
4. **Access** — Unpaved roads, no broadband, limited cell service

### Electoral Profile

- **Political lean: Unknown/Irrelevant at this scale** — Probably fewer than 100 voters in the entire area
- Likely conservative given demographics
- **A campaign visit to the Amerind Museum could generate positive attention** — demonstrates cultural awareness and respect for Native American heritage, even in a community with almost no voters

### Hospital Access (Drive Times)

| Community | Nearest Hospital | Distance | Drive Time |
|-----------|-----------------|----------|------------|
| Benson | Benson Hospital (limited) | In town | 0 min |
| Willcox | Northern Cochise Community Hospital | In town (very limited) | 0 min |

## Campaign Strategy Notes

### Tier 1 Targets (invest significant time)

**Willcox** — The crown jewel of these smaller communities for a Democratic campaign. Majority-Hispanic, economically distressed, water crisis is bipartisan. Wine industry creates moderate entrepreneurial class. The poverty rate and income data make economic justice messaging concrete, not abstract. Spend multiple days here. Walk Allen Street. Visit vineyards. Attend the livestock auction. Eat at the Mexican restaurants. Be seen.

**Benson** — Lupe Diaz's hometown, which makes it both challenging and strategically important. Competing here demonstrates ambition. The Vigneto water controversy is a wedge that doesn't fall on party lines. Kartchner Caverns tourism economy means service workers who understand low wages. The I-10 corridor traffic makes Benson a crossroads — campaign visibility here reaches travelers too.

### Tier 2 Targets (regular presence)

**Huachuca City** — Military families are persuadable when you speak their language. Worker housing, base stability, VA access, school quality. Don't talk culture war. Talk about making sure the families who serve this country can afford to live where they serve. The diversity of this community (nearly 40% Hispanic, 7% Black) means it's less monolithically Republican than it appears.

**Hereford** — You won't win here, but how you handle border questions in Hereford determines your credibility across the district. Residents here live with border consequences daily. Acknowledge it. Have specific, practical positions. Don't lecture. Listen first.

### Tier 3 Presence (visit, listen, don't ignore)

**St. David** — The artesian wells story is campaign gold. "St. David's wells used to flow on their own. Now they're dry. That's what happens when nobody writes the rules." One visit, one powerful anecdote for stump speeches.

**Pearce/Sunsites** — Healthcare desert messaging. "If you have a heart attack in Sunsites, the nearest hospital is 55 minutes away. That's not healthcare — that's a prayer."

**Tombstone** — Show up during Helldorado Days. Be visible. Don't campaign aggressively — just be present and approachable. Tombstone residents respect someone willing to walk into a room where they're outnumbered.

**Bowie** — One day visit. Walk every street (it won't take long). The message writes itself: "I came to a community of 400 people because you deserve representation too."

**Dragoon** — Visit the Amerind Museum. Post about it. Show cultural awareness. Maybe 100 voters total, but the narrative value exceeds the vote count.

### Key Messages by Community

| Community | Lead Message | Supporting Messages |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| Benson | "Your water isn't for sale to developers" | Healthcare access, economic opportunity |
| Willcox | "74% of Arizona's wine comes from here — you deserve to keep the water that grows it" | Poverty, agricultural sustainability, education |
| Tombstone | "Your town survived Wyatt Earp, the Depression, and COVID. You deserve a representative who shows up." | Water, tourism economy, healthcare |
| Huachuca City | "The families who protect this country deserve a town that protects them back" | Housing, infrastructure, base stability |
| St. David | "When the wells stop flowing, someone failed you" | Rural services, agricultural preservation |
| Hereford | "I hear you on the border. Let me tell you what I'd actually do." | Water, rural services |
| Pearce/Sunsites | "55 minutes to the nearest hospital isn't healthcare. We can do better." | Broadband, fixed-income protections |
| Bowie | "400 people still deserve a representative who knows your name" | Poverty, isolation, school funding |
| Dragoon | "Arizona's heritage lives here" | Cultural preservation, fire safety |
