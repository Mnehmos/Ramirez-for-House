| **Unemployment (2024)** | 3.0% | 2.8% | 3.3% | ~4.9% |

- **NOTE:** Income figures have improved significantly in recent years, likely driven by mining wages and tight labor market. The 2023 ACS median household income for Safford ($65,727) is substantially higher than earlier estimates (~$42,000-45,000 from prior ACS cycles)
- Despite income improvements, **poverty remains stubbornly high at 17.7% countywide**

- **The poverty-amid-employment paradox:** Low unemployment + high poverty = many working poor
- **Campaign implication:** Economic messaging is not abstract here -- it's about the gap between mining wealth extracted and community wealth retained

### 2D. Housing & Cost of Living

| Metric | Safford | Thatcher [E] | Graham County | Arizona |
|--------|---------|--------------|---------------|---------|
| **Median home value** | $232,259 (Zillow 2025) | ~$200,000-220,000 | $202,700 (ACS) | ~$310,000 |
| **Median listing price** | $275,000-$322,500 | -- | -- | ~$430,000 |

| **Building permits (2024)** | -- | -- | 133 single-family (down from 159 in 2023) | -- |

- Housing is **more affordable than metro Arizona** but prices have been rising rapidly (Safford home values up 2.8% in past year; some bedroom categories up 46%)
- Thatcher's higher home values reflect newer construction and LDS community property investment
- Home values have risen sharply in recent years; median listing of $322,500 vs ACS median of $202,700 shows significant recent appreciation
- County rental market ($890/month for renters) ranks 10th highest in state despite low incomes
- **Housing competition:** Greenlee and Graham counties face "fierce competition and few options" per Eastern Arizona Courier

### 2E. Economic Vulnerabilities

1. **Single-employer dependency:** Freeport-McMoRan copper price fluctuations directly impact county revenue and employment
2. **Water scarcity:** Agricultural sector is existentially threatened by declining Gila River flows and groundwater disputes
3. **Brain drain:** Young people with degrees leave for Tucson/Phoenix; EAC is a launch pad out, not an anchor
4. **Prison economy dependency:** If federal/state corrections policy shifts, significant jobs could disappear
5. **Retail leakage:** Residents drive to Tucson (2+ hours) for major purchases; limited local retail diversity
6. **Per capita income dead last:** Despite mining wealth, residents see lowest personal income of any AZ county
7. **GDP decline:** Real GDP fell 2.2% from 2022-2023 despite population growth

### 3G. Special Districts

| District | Type | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|

- Republican voter registration dominance: estimated 55-60% R, 15-20% D, 20-25% I [V]
- **Notable exception:** Supervisor Paul R. David (District 1) is a registered Democrat -- worth studying how he wins
- **LDS (Mormon) influence:** Profound, especially in Thatcher (see Section 5E)
- **Hispanic political participation:** Despite ~30% of county population being Hispanic (46.7% in Safford), representation in local offices has historically been lower than proportional share
- **Labor history:** Mining unions were historically powerful but Freeport decertified unions in the 1980s; remnant labor sentiment exists among older workers

---

## 4. KEY ISSUES

### 4A. Water Rights -- The Existential Issue

**This is the #1 issue in the Gila Valley and it affects everything else.**

**The Core Dispute:**
- Wells in the Gila Valley have operated since the 1930s
- San Carlos Apache Tribe (SCAT) attorneys claim wells are "illegally" drawing **subflow** (river water from below ground) that belongs to tribal interests
- Farmers argue wells tap Goodwin Wash water sources historically unconnected to the Gila River
- In Safford alone, wells provide an estimated **60% of water supply** during dry summer months
- Approximately **30,000 acres of productive farmland** is threatened

**The Gila River Adjudication:**
- One of the longest-running water rights cases in U.S. history
- Involves **38,000+ parties** -- everyone who claims water rights must file or risk losing them
- Two major adjudications: Gila River System and Little Colorado River System
- ADWR filed technical reports on subflow delineation; trials held August 2024
- Special Master issued March 2025 order requiring ADWR to reevaluate all subflow mapping termination points by August 2025
- **The legal definition of "subflow" vs "groundwater" will determine who has water rights** -- this is the existential question

**The Upper Gila River Alliance:**
- Coalition of farmers and local businesses formed to end "water war" with Apaches
- Key member: Justin Layton (farms ~1,300 acres of cotton)
- Seeks to replace litigation with direct negotiations
- Proposes activating the **Emery Pipeline** (capable of 10,000 gallons per minute to the reservation)
- Goal: provide San Carlos tribe with water while protecting farmer well access
- Frames the issue as "water is the key to our shared future and prosperity"

**Mining Water Use:**
- Freeport-McMoRan claims water comes from distinct aquifers (Fracture Zone and Lower Basin Fill) isolated from the Shallow Alluvial Aquifer adjacent to the Gila River
- Claims 93% water recycling rate
- Tension between mining water rights and residential/agricultural needs persists

**Campaign angle:** The Family Well Protection Act (Bill #1) directly addresses this -- protecting residential wells from being drained by industrial/agricultural mega-pumping

### 4B. Mining Impacts

- **Economic dependence:** Freeport provides jobs and tax revenue but extracts copper worth billions while returning a fraction to the local economy
- **Lone Star Expansion:** Major expansion underway -- targeting 300M lbs copper/year, up from 200M; Phase II leach pad online April 2025; Phase 2A construction began H2 2025; pre-feasibility for further expansion expected late 2025
- **Environmental profile:**
  - Safford mine is a **zero-discharge facility** (company claim)
  - Water drawn from deep aquifers (claimed distinct from Gila River alluvial aquifer)
  - Dust, land disturbance from open-pit operations
  - The 2012 $6.8M settlement for acidic water outflows from Morenci remains in memory
- **Tax structure:** Arizona's 2.5% mining severance tax is among the lowest in western states
- **Union history:** The 1983 Morenci strike and subsequent union decertification remains in living memory. Freeport effectively broke organized labor in the region.
- **Company influence:** Freeport's economic dominance gives it enormous informal political power
- **Campaign angle:** Mine-to-Wire Act (Bill #2) and Worker Privacy & Safety Act (Bill #3) directly address the mining-community power imbalance

### 4C. Poverty & Economic Development

- **17.7% poverty rate** (county-wide); 20.5% in Safford; 20.4% child poverty county-wide
- **Dead last** in per capita income among Arizona's 15 counties ($42,787 = 68.4% of state avg)
- **The paradox:** Unemployment is low (3.3%) but poverty is high -- working poor population
- **Wages:** Average annual wage of $57,631 is only 87.7% of state average
- **Economic development challenges:**
  - Remote location (2+ hours from Tucson, 3+ from Phoenix)
  - Limited broadband infrastructure [V]
  - Workforce education gaps (26% without HS diploma in Safford area)
  - Inability to compete with urban areas for business attraction
- **Brain drain:** EAC graduates often leave; top programs (HVAC, nursing) produce portable credentials
- **Positive signs:** Fastest household growth in AZ (15.6% since 2018); retail (+3.6%), restaurant (+5.3%), hotel (+12.4%) growth
- **Campaign angle:** The core economic message resonates here -- "your community creates $1.7 billion in GDP and your per capita income ranks dead last"

### 4D. Healthcare Access

**Mt. Graham Regional Medical Center (MGRMC)**
- **The only hospital** serving Graham and Greenlee counties combined (~50,000 people)
- Located in Safford; ~50 beds; rural non-profit critical access hospital

- Financial pressure: Rural hospitals nationwide face closure threats; MGRMC has historically operated on thin margins [V]
- **VA access:** Nearest VA hospital is Tucson (~2-3 hours). Limited outpatient services locally [V]
- **Campaign angle:** Rural Healthcare Access Act (Bill #4) directly addresses this

### 4E. Education

## 6. STRATEGIC ASSESSMENT

### 6A. Community Strengths (Campaign Relevance)

1. **Relatively affordable housing** -- still below metro AZ averages despite recent appreciation
2. **Strong community bonds** -- small-town social fabric is intact; people know each other
3. **EAC as an anchor** -- educational institution with deep 138-year community roots
4. **Young population** -- median ages of 31.3 (Safford) and 29.6 (Thatcher) vs Green Valley at 73.3

7. **Fastest household growth** in Arizona (15.6% since 2018) -- community is attracting people
8. **World-class scientific assets** -- Large Binocular Telescope, Discovery Park

### 6B. Community Pain Points (Campaign Messaging Opportunities)

1. **Water** -- The existential threat that transcends party lines. Everyone drinks water. 60% of Safford's summer supply comes from wells. 30,000 acres of farmland threatened.
2. **Poverty amid extraction wealth** -- $1.7B GDP but dead-last per capita income; 17.7% poverty; mining wages of $80K vs county average of $57K
3. **Healthcare crisis** -- One 50-bed hospital for 50,000 people; chronic staffing shortages; travel nurses filling gaps; specialists require 2+ hour drives
4. **Education gaps** -- 26% without HS diploma in Safford area; teacher shortage; 23.6:1 student-teacher ratio
5. **Brain drain** -- Young people leave because degrees are portable; top EAC programs (HVAC, nursing) train people to leave
6. **Housing squeeze** -- Fierce competition, few options, rising prices, mining demand driving costs
7. **Governance instability** -- Safford lost a mayor, fired a city manager; Thatcher had multiple council resignations

### 6C. Political Landscape

- **Challenge:** Graham County is among the most Republican counties in Arizona (~70%+ for Trump)
- **Opportunity:**
  - **Supervisor Paul David (D, District 1) wins as a Democrat** -- study his approach
  - The Hispanic population (30% county, 47% Safford) is underrepresented in voting and local offices
  - Economic messaging (not culture war) can reach working-class voters who feel left behind
  - Water is a bipartisan survival issue -- the Upper Gila River Alliance is not partisan
  - LDS communitarian ethic can be a bridge on healthcare and education
  - Jenny Howard becoming Thatcher's first female mayor shows openness to change
- **Realistic expectation:** A Democratic candidate will not win Graham County, but can **reduce margins** and build credibility for future cycles

1. **Mayor Richard Ortega (Safford)** -- navigating governance transition
2. **Mayor Jenny Howard (Thatcher)** -- first female mayor, historic figure
3. **Supervisor Paul R. David (D, District 1)** -- the Democrat who wins in deep red territory
4. **Supervisor John Howard (R, District 2) & Clay Mack (R, District 3)** -- county power
5. **Sheriff Preston "PJ" Allred** -- law enforcement relationship
6. **EAC President** [V] -- educational leader, community convener
7. **MGRMC CEO/Administrator** -- healthcare voice
8. **Eastern Arizona Courier editor/publisher** -- media gatekeeper
9. **Justin Layton (Upper Gila River Alliance)** -- water rights advocate, farms 1,300 acres
10. **LDS Stake Presidents (Safford & Thatcher Stakes)** -- religious community leaders
11. **Catholic parish priest(s)** -- Hispanic community connection
