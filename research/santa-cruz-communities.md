| **2010 Census Population** | 913 | Census 2010 |
| **Population Change 2010-2020** | **-12.4%** (declining) | Census |
| **Latest Estimate (2023)** | ~780-820 | ACS |
| **Median Age** | ~52-55 | ACS 2018-2022 `[VERIFY]` |
| **% Under 18** | ~15-18% | ACS |
| **% 18-64** | ~52-55% | ACS |
| **% 65+** | ~28-33% | ACS |
| **Households** | ~420-440 | ACS |
| **Average Household Size** | ~2.0-2.1 | ACS |

#### Racial/Ethnic Composition

| Group | Percentage |
|-------|-----------|
| **White (non-Hispanic)** | ~50-55% |
| **Hispanic/Latino** | ~40-45% |
| **Native American** | ~1-2% |
| **African American** | <1% |
| **Two or More Races** | ~2-3% |

**Note:** Patagonia has a significantly higher Hispanic/Latino population than many other LD-19 communities, reflecting its proximity to the border and deep historical ties to Sonora, Mexico. The town's name itself derives from the ranching families who settled the area in the 1800s.

#### Income & Poverty

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Median Household Income** | ~$35,000-$42,000 `[VERIFY]` |
| **Per Capita Income** | ~$22,000-$28,000 |
| **Poverty Rate** | ~18-24% `[VERIFY]` |
| **Families Below Poverty** | ~15-20% |

**Context:** Patagonia's income levels are notably lower than the LD-19 average. This is a community with a significant low-income population alongside a growing second-home/retirement contingent, creating a two-tier economy.

#### Educational Attainment (Age 25+)

| Level | Percentage |
|-------|-----------|
| **High School Diploma or Higher** | ~80-85% |
| **Bachelor's Degree or Higher** | ~25-32% |
| **Graduate/Professional Degree** | ~12-18% |

**Note:** The bachelor's+ rate is relatively high for a rural Arizona community of this size, driven by the arts community and retirees. This is an audience receptive to policy-detailed messaging.

### Economics

#### Economic Drivers

1. **Tourism (Primary Growth Sector)**
   - **Birding tourism** is the signature economic driver. Patagonia sits at the convergence of several biomes and is one of the top birding destinations in North America
   - The **Paton Center for Hummingbirds** (operated by Tucson Audubon Society) draws thousands of visitors annually — particularly for rare species like the Violet-crowned Hummingbird
   - The **Nature Conservancy's Patagonia-Sonoita Creek Preserve** (~750 acres) is another major draw, featuring one of Arizona's rarest habitats: cottonwood-willow riparian forest
   - Seasonal tourism peaks: spring (March-May) and fall (August-October) birding seasons; summer monsoon season also draws visitors
   - Tourism supports restaurants, lodging (Duquesne House B&B, Stage Stop Inn, various vacation rentals), and shops

2. **Arts Economy**
   - Patagonia has cultivated a genuine arts community disproportionate to its size
   - Multiple galleries, studios, and arts organizations
   - Monthly art walks draw regional visitors
   - The **Patagonia Creative Arts Center** (also called the Patagonia Creative Arts Association) is a hub
   - Working artists include painters, sculptors, ceramicists, writers, and musicians
   - The arts economy includes both production (studios, workshops) and tourism (gallery sales, events)

3. **Ranching**
   - Historic and ongoing cattle ranching in surrounding grasslands
   - The Sonoita-Patagonia region is known for high-quality grasslands
   - Ranches operate on both private land and federal/state grazing leases
   - Ranching is declining as an economic force but remains culturally central
   - Several ranches have diversified into guest ranching or conservation easements

4. **Government/Public Sector**
   - Town of Patagonia government
   - Patagonia Union High School District and Patagonia Elementary School District
   - U.S. Forest Service (Coronado National Forest — Patagonia is a gateway)
   - U.S. Border Patrol presence (Sonoita Station covers this area)

#### Where Residents Work

- Many residents are self-employed (artists, ranchers, small business owners)
- Tourism/hospitality sector
- Government (schools, town, federal agencies)
- Significant number commute to **Nogales** (~30 min north on SR-82) or **Sierra Vista** (~45 min east)
- Some commute to **Tucson** (~60-75 min via SR-82 and I-19)
- Retirement income is significant — many residents are not in the workforce

#### Cost of Living

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Median Home Value** | ~$200,000-$280,000 `[VERIFY]` |
| **Median Rent** | ~$700-$900/month `[VERIFY]` |
| **Home Ownership Rate** | ~65-72% |

**Affordability Tension:** Second-home buyers and retirees have driven up property values, creating affordability pressure on long-term residents and younger families. This is a tangible local issue.

### Governance

#### Town of Patagonia (Incorporated)

| Position | Name | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|
| **Mayor** | **Andrea Wood** | Confirmed as of 2025 |
| **Vice Mayor** | **Michael Stabile** | Confirmed as of 2025 |

## Sonoita / Elgin

### Overview

Sonoita and Elgin are **unincorporated communities** in Santa Cruz County, governed by the County Board of Supervisors. They are closely linked geographically (Elgin is ~7 miles south of Sonoita along SR-83) and share economic identity as Arizona's premier wine-growing region.

- **Sonoita** is located at the crossroads of SR-83 and SR-82, making it a natural hub
- **Elgin** is a smaller community south along SR-83, surrounded by vineyards and ranches
- Together they form the heart of the **Sonoita/Elgin American Viticultural Area (AVA)**, designated in 1984 — one of Arizona's original AVAs

### Demographics

#### Sonoita CDP

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| **2020 Census Population** | 818 | Census 2020 `[VERIFY — this is CDP boundary]` |
| **2010 Census Population** | 826 | Census 2010 |
| **Population Change 2010-2020** | ~-1% (stable/slight decline) | Census |
| **Median Age** | ~55-60 | ACS `[VERIFY]` |
| **% Under 18** | ~12-15% | ACS |
| **% 65+** | ~30-38% | ACS |
| **Households** | ~350-400 | ACS |

**Note:** The Sonoita CDP boundary may not fully capture the dispersed rural population. Actual community population including surrounding ranch properties may be higher.

#### Elgin CDP

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| **2020 Census Population** | ~161 `[VERIFY]` | Census 2020 |
| **2010 Census Population** | ~161 | Census 2010 |

**Note:** Elgin is extremely small as a CDP. Many "Elgin area" residents may fall outside the CDP boundary but identify with the community. Combined Sonoita-Elgin area population is likely closer to 1,000-1,200 when including surrounding unincorporated ranch properties.

#### Racial/Ethnic Composition (Sonoita area)

| Group | Percentage |
|-------|-----------|
| **White (non-Hispanic)** | ~65-75% |
| **Hispanic/Latino** | ~20-30% |
| **Native American** | ~1-2% |
| **Other/Two+ Races** | ~2-4% |

**Note:** Sonoita/Elgin skews whiter and wealthier than Patagonia, reflecting its identity as a wine/tourism/retirement destination with higher property values.

#### Income & Poverty (Sonoita CDP)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Median Household Income** | ~$50,000-$65,000 `[VERIFY]` |
| **Per Capita Income** | ~$30,000-$40,000 |
| **Poverty Rate** | ~10-15% `[VERIFY]` |

**Context:** Sonoita/Elgin incomes are higher than Patagonia's, driven by the winery economy, tourism businesses, and wealthier retirees/second-home owners. There is still a significant working-class ranching population.

#### Educational Attainment (Sonoita area, Age 25+)

| Level | Percentage |
|-------|-----------|
| **High School Diploma or Higher** | ~88-93% |
| **Bachelor's Degree or Higher** | ~35-42% |
| **Graduate/Professional Degree** | ~15-22% |

**Note:** Higher educational attainment than Patagonia and significantly higher than most rural LD-19 communities. This is an educated, engaged electorate.

### Economics

#### The Wine Industry

The Sonoita/Elgin AVA is the economic centerpiece:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **AVA Established** | 1984 (Arizona's first) |
| **Elevation** | ~4,800-5,200 ft |
| **Climate** | High-desert grassland, ideal for certain grape varietals |
| **Wineries/Tasting Rooms (active)** | **15** (verified via Sonoita/Elgin Chamber 2025; 4 others permanently closed) |

**Known Wineries/Tasting Rooms** (as of 2024-2025):

1. **Callaghan Vineyards** — Established 1990, one of Arizona's most acclaimed; Robert Parker rated wines in the 90s
2. **Sonoita Vineyards** — One of the original Arizona wineries (founded 1983 by Gordon Dutt, a University of Arizona soil scientist)
3. **Dos Cabezas WineWorks** — Relocated to Sonoita area; nationally recognized
4. **Village of Elgin Winery** — Community-focused, popular tasting room
5. **Arizona Hops & Vines** — Wine and craft beer
6. **Lightning Ridge Cellars** — Boutique producer
7. **Rancho Rossa Vineyards** — Estate winery
8. **Kief-Joshua Vineyards** — In Elgin, well-known tasting room
9. **Flying Leap Vineyards & Distillery** — Wine + spirits
10. **Deep Sky Vineyard** — Newer entrant `[VERIFY]`
11. **Rune Wines** — `[VERIFY if still active]`
12. **Charron Vineyards** — `[VERIFY]`

**Wine Industry Economic Impact:**
- Tourism draws from Tucson (60 miles), Phoenix (3+ hours), and nationally
- Weekend wine tourism is a major economic driver, especially fall through spring
- The wine trail supports restaurants, lodging, and retail
- Most wineries are small/family-owned operations employing 2-10 people each
- Total wine-related employment in the area: estimated 80-150 `[VERIFY]`
- Arizona wine industry overall has grown significantly; Sonoita/Elgin is the prestige region

#### Other Economic Drivers

1. **Ranching**
   - The Sonoita grasslands are some of the finest cattle country in southern Arizona
   - Ranch properties are large (thousands of acres) and sparse
   - Ranching economy has been stressed by drought, rising costs, and land pressure
   - Some ranches have transitioned to conservation-oriented management

2. **Tourism (non-wine)**
   - Gateway to Coronado National Forest
   - Empire Ranch (BLM-managed historic ranch, open for events)
   - Arizona Trail passes through the area
   - Horseback riding, hiking, hunting
   - Sonoita Fairgrounds hosts events year-round

3. **Government/Public Sector**
   - Elgin School District
   - Santa Cruz County services
   - U.S. Border Patrol (Sonoita Station)
   - USFS Coronado National Forest

#### Where Residents Work

- Self-employed: winery owners, ranchers, artists, consultants
- Wine/tourism/hospitality sector locally
- Many commute to **Sierra Vista** (~30-40 min), **Tucson** (~60 min), or **Nogales** (~45 min)
- Significant retired population not in workforce
- Some telework/remote workers drawn by rural lifestyle

#### Cost of Living

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Median Home Value** | ~$280,000-$400,000 `[VERIFY]` |
| **Median Rent** | ~$800-$1,100/month `[VERIFY]` |
| **Home Ownership Rate** | ~75-82% |

**Note:** Sonoita/Elgin property values are notably higher than Patagonia's and most of rural LD-19. Land is expensive due to limited supply, scenic value, and wine country cachet. Ranch properties can run into the millions.

### Governance

#### Sonoita/Elgin — Unincorporated

| Entity | Governing Body | Notes |
|--------|---------------|-------|
| **General Government** | Santa Cruz County Board of Supervisors | Sonoita/Elgin falls in District 2 `[VERIFY]` |
| **Planning/Zoning** | Santa Cruz County Development Services | County zoning applies |
| **Law Enforcement** | Santa Cruz County Sheriff's Office | No municipal police |
| **Fire Protection** | Sonoita-Elgin Fire District | Combination volunteer/paid `[VERIFY]` |
| **Water** | Private wells (most residents) | Some community water systems `[VERIFY]` |
| **Roads** | Santa Cruz County / ADOT (SR-82, SR-83) | County maintains local roads |

#### School Districts

| District | Type | Enrollment | Notes |
|----------|------|-----------|-------|
| **Elgin School District #22** | K-8 | ~100-130 students `[VERIFY]` | Small rural school |

**Note:** High school students from Elgin/Sonoita area typically attend **Patagonia Union High School** or are bused to **Santa Cruz Valley Union High School** in Elgin `[VERIFY — there may be a high school in the area]`. Some students go to schools in Sierra Vista or Vail.

#### Sonoita-Elgin Fire District

- Combination volunteer/career department `[VERIFY]`
- Serves a large geographic area with sparse population
- Response times can be significant due to distances
- Fire risk is elevated during drought (grassland fires)

## Santa Cruz County Governance

### County Board of Supervisors

Santa Cruz County has 3 supervisorial districts:

| District | Name | Party | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|-------|
| **District 1** | **Luis Carlos Davis** | **D** | Includes Nogales area — **NEW (2025)** |
| **District 2** | **Rudy Molera** | **D** | 5th term — long-serving, institutional knowledge. Covers portions of county including some rural areas |
| **District 3** | **John Fanning** | **D** | **NEW (2025)** — covers Patagonia/Sonoita/Elgin area (LD-19 overlap) |

**Context:** Santa Cruz County is one of Arizona's most Democratic counties, driven by its heavily Hispanic population and border-adjacent economy. The county votes ~70%+ Democratic in presidential elections. **The BOS is ALL DEMOCRAT** — a stark contrast to Cochise County's all-Republican board. The portions of the county in LD-19 (Patagonia, Sonoita, Elgin) are more mixed politically than Nogales, but the county-level governance is firmly Democratic.

**KEY CAMPAIGN NOTE:** John Fanning (D-D3) covers the Patagonia/Sonoita area and is a **natural ally** for LD-19 Democratic candidates. Rudy Molera's 5-term institutional knowledge makes him a valuable contact. Luis Carlos Davis is new but represents the county's Democratic base.

---

## Political Profile

### Overall Character

These Santa Cruz County communities are **among the most progressive areas within LD-19**, though "progressive" needs context:

- **Not urban-progressive** — They are not ideologically left in the way Tucson or Phoenix precincts are
- **Environmentally progressive** — Strong conservation ethic, opposition to mining/development that threatens natural landscape
- **Libertarian-progressive hybrid** — "Leave us alone" combined with "protect public lands"
- **Arts community leanings** — The creative class in Patagonia trends progressive/Democratic
- **Ranching community leanings** — Traditional ranchers trend conservative/Republican but are pragmatic on land/water issues

### Voter Registration (Estimated for Patagonia/Sonoita/Elgin Precincts)

| Party | Estimated % | Notes |
|-------|------------|-------|
| **Republican** | ~35-40% | Lower than LD-19 overall (43%) |
| **Democratic** | ~30-35% | Higher than LD-19 overall (24%) |
| **Independent/Other** | ~28-35% | Similar to LD-19 overall (33%) |

**Note:** `[VERIFY]` — Precinct-level registration data from Santa Cruz County Recorder needed. These estimates are based on the communities' known character relative to the district.

### 2024 Election Results (Precinct-Level)

`[VERIFY]` — Need precinct-level results from Santa Cruz County. Expected patterns:

- **Presidential:** These precincts likely went for the Democratic candidate by a modest margin or were very competitive, unlike most LD-19 precincts
- **State House:** With only one Democratic candidate (Frostrom Jr.) versus two Republicans, vote share may have been more competitive here than the district-wide 23% D figure
- **Key down-ballot:** County-level races reflect Santa Cruz County's Democratic lean

### Environmental Activism

This is the defining political characteristic of these communities:

1. **Anti-mining activism** — The Rosemont/Copper World mine proposal has been the galvanizing issue (see Key Issues below)
2. **Water conservation advocacy** — Drought and groundwater depletion are urgent
3. **Conservation easement support** — Many ranchers have embraced conservation easements
4. **Public lands defense** — Coronado National Forest, Nature Conservancy preserve, and BLM lands are seen as community assets, not federal overreach
5. **Dark skies advocacy** — Light pollution is an issue for the astronomy/tourism economy

### Key Political Organizations

- **Save the Scenic Santa Ritas** — Anti-mining advocacy group focused on Rosemont/Copper World — **ACTIVE**, currently litigating Copper World permits
- **Friends of Sonoita Creek** — Conservation group
- **Patagonia Area Resource Alliance (PARA)** — `[VERIFY]` Environmental advocacy
- **Borderlands Restoration Network** — Ecological restoration, politically engaged
- **Santa Cruz Valley Democratic Club** — `[VERIFY]` Local party organization
- Various conservation-oriented land trusts

### Political Implications for Campaign

| Factor | Implication |
|--------|------------|
| Higher D registration | **Base building territory** — more receptive to Democratic candidate |
| Environmental ethic | **Mining/water messaging resonates strongly** — Ramirez's Mine to Wire Act aligns |
| Arts community | **Cultural alignment** — progressive on social issues, receptive to nuanced policy |
| Hispanic population (Patagonia) | **Cultural competency matters** — bilingual outreach, border nuance |
| Higher education levels | **Policy-detailed messaging works** — don't dumb it down |
| Small population | **Low vote yield** — ~400-600 total voters across both communities |
| BUT high engagement | **Influence multiplier** — these residents talk, organize, write letters, host events |

---

## Key Issues

### 1. Water

**Severity: CRITICAL**

- **Groundwater decline:** The Sonoita-Patagonia area relies primarily on groundwater. The regional aquifer has shown declining water tables over decades.
- **Drought:** Persistent drought conditions since the early 2000s have stressed wells, creeks, and springs
- **Sonoita Creek:** Historically perennial, now intermittent in stretches. The Nature Conservancy preserve exists specifically to protect remaining riparian habitat
- **Domestic wells:** Many Sonoita/Elgin residents on private wells report declining water levels
- **Agricultural water use:** Ranching and vineyard irrigation compete with domestic use
- **No Active Management Area (AMA):** Unlike Phoenix or Tucson metro areas, this region is NOT in a state-designated Active Management Area, meaning groundwater pumping is largely unregulated
- **Campaign relevance:** Water is the #1 non-partisan issue. Everyone cares. Ramirez's Family Well Protection Act is directly relevant here.

### 2. Mining Threats — Rosemont/Copper World

**Severity: HIGH (defining issue for these communities)**

- **Rosemont Mine** (Hudbay Minerals): Proposed open-pit copper mine in the Santa Rita Mountains, ~30 miles north of Patagonia
  - Would be one of the largest copper mines in U.S. history
  - ~19,000-acre disturbance area
  - The mine was approved by the Trump administration in 2019, blocked by federal courts in 2019 (ruling that the Forest Service lacked authority to approve the mine plan)
  - **Copper World:** After the Rosemont setback, Hudbay rebranded/reconfigured the project as "Copper World" targeting private/state land portions that don't require federal approval
  - **FULLY PERMITTED as of January 2025:** Copper World received all three required state permits (Aquifer Protection Permit, Air Quality Permit, and Mined Land Reclamation Plan). Feasibility study expected to complete in first half of 2026.
  - **Active litigation continues:** Save the Scenic Santa Ritas and other groups are challenging permits in court
  - Opponents argue the mine would:
    - Devastate the regional water table
    - Destroy scenic landscape critical for tourism/property values
    - Generate massive tailings waste
    - Threaten Sonoita Creek and downstream water supplies
    - Increase truck traffic through small communities
  - **Local opposition is intense and bipartisan** — ranchers, environmentalists, tourism businesses, retirees, artists all oppose
  - This is the issue that most unites these otherwise diverse communities
- **Campaign relevance:** The Mine to Wire Act's worker safety and environmental provisions resonate, but Ramirez should also speak to the specific Rosemont/Copper World threat. Even the *framing* of being pro-responsible-mining while opposing this specific project works here.

### 3. Tourism vs. Development

**Severity: MODERATE**

- Short-term vacation rentals (Airbnb/VRBO) are increasing, driving up housing costs
- Wine tourism brings traffic and economic benefits but also development pressure
- Residents worry about losing the rural character that makes these communities special
- Sonoita crossroads area has seen some commercial development pressure
- Arizona's preemption of local short-term rental regulations (SB 1350, 2016) means communities cannot regulate vacation rentals, generating frustration

### 4. Border Proximity

**Severity: MODERATE (locally nuanced)**

- Patagonia is ~20 miles from the Mexican border
- Sonoita is ~25-30 miles from the border
- **Border Patrol presence:** The Sonoita Border Patrol Station is a visible presence; checkpoints on SR-83 are routine
- **Migrant traffic:** The corridor sees migrant and drug trafficking activity, though less than the Nogales or Douglas corridors
- **Local perspective is nuanced:**
  - Long-term residents (especially Hispanic families) have deep cross-border ties
  - Ranchers deal with property damage from migrant crossings but many oppose a wall
  - The arts/environmental community tends toward humanitarian concern
  - Unlike Sierra Vista/Cochise County, the dominant frame here is NOT "border security" but rather "humane policy + property rights"
- **Campaign relevance:** Avoid the culture-war border framing. Lead with property rights, humanitarian concerns, and economic ties to Sonora. This is NOT Trump country on this issue.

### 5. Healthcare Access

**Severity: HIGH**

- **Nearest hospital:** Holy Cross Hospital in **Nogales** (~30 min from Patagonia, ~45 min from Sonoita) `[VERIFY if still operating/name]`
  - Alternatively, Sierra Vista Regional Health Center (~45 min from Sonoita, ~60 min from Patagonia)
  - Tucson hospitals are 60-90 minutes
- **Local healthcare:** The **Mariposa Community Health Center** operates a clinic in Patagonia `[VERIFY]`
- **EMS response times:** Extended due to rural distances; can be 20-40 minutes
- **Provider shortage:** Specialist care requires travel to Tucson or Sierra Vista
- **Pharmacy access:** Limited locally; many residents drive to Nogales or Sierra Vista for pharmacy
- **Campaign relevance:** Rural Healthcare Access Act is directly relevant. Telehealth expansion, EMS funding, and provider incentives all resonate.

### 6. Broadband/Connectivity

**Severity: MODERATE-HIGH**

- Both communities have limited broadband infrastructure
- Many residents rely on satellite or fixed wireless with limited speeds
- Remote work potential is constrained by connectivity
- The pandemic exposed this gap acutely
- Federal infrastructure funding (BEAD program) may bring improvements `[VERIFY status]`
- **Campaign relevance:** Broadband is bipartisan. Connecting rural communities enables economic opportunity, healthcare (telehealth), and education.

### 7. Property Values & Affordability

**Severity: MODERATE-HIGH (especially Patagonia)**

- Second-home buyers (from Tucson, Phoenix, out of state) have driven up property values
- Long-term Hispanic families in Patagonia face displacement pressure
- Working-class artists and young families struggle to afford housing
- Sonoita/Elgin is already a higher-cost market; affordability is less acute but still present
- Rental housing is extremely scarce in both communities
- **Campaign relevance:** Worker Housing Freedom Act could resonate, though these communities are small enough that housing policy feels more state/federal than local.

## Campaign Strategy Notes

### Why These Communities Matter (Despite Small Size)

1. **Influence disproportionate to population:** These are engaged, vocal, connected communities. An endorsement from Patagonia opinion leaders ripples outward.
2. **Base territory:** At ~30-35% Democratic registration (vs. 24% district-wide), these are among the few LD-19 communities where Democrats have meaningful presence.
3. **Issue alignment:** Ramirez's platform (mining accountability, healthcare access, worker protections, housing) maps almost perfectly to local concerns.
4. **Persuadable independents and Republicans:** The environmental/conservation ethic crosses party lines. Republican ranchers who oppose Rosemont mine are reachable.
5. **Media multiplier:** Coverage in Patagonia Regional Times reaches an engaged readership. Events in these communities generate regional coverage.
6. **Donor potential:** The arts community and wine country retirees include potential donors with above-average disposable income and political engagement.

### Messaging Recommendations

| Audience | Lead Issue | Frame |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| **Artists/creatives** | Healthcare access, housing affordability | "Creative communities need affordable healthcare and housing to survive" |
| **Ranchers** | Water, mining, property rights | "Protecting the land and water your family depends on" |
| **Wine industry** | Tourism economy, water, development balance | "Growing the economy without destroying what makes it special" |
| **Retirees** | Healthcare, cost of living, community character | "Protecting the quality of life you chose this place for" |
| **Hispanic families** | Affordability, border nuance, education | "Your family has been here for generations — you shouldn't be priced out" |
| **Environmental advocates** | Rosemont/Copper World, water, conservation | "Standing up to corporate mining interests that threaten our water and land" |

### Tactical Recommendations

1. **Host a "winery town hall"** at a Sonoita/Elgin tasting room — combine wine country ambiance with policy discussion
2. **Birding community outreach** — Connect with Tucson Audubon/Paton Center leadership; birders are organized and politically engaged
3. **Attend the Sonoita rodeo/horse show** — visibility in the ranching community
4. **Op-ed in Patagonia Regional Times** — high-impact, low-cost
5. **Art walk presence** — set up at a Patagonia art walk with campaign materials
6. **Partner with Borderlands Restoration Network** — shared values on land/water
7. **Mine to Wire Act framing** — specifically connect it to the Rosemont/Copper World fight
8. **Bilingual materials** — essential for Patagonia's Hispanic community

### Vote Yield Estimate

| Community | Registered Voters (est.) | Likely Turnout | Estimated Votes Available |
|-----------|--------------------------|---------------|--------------------------|
| Patagonia | ~550-650 | ~55-65% (high for rural) | ~330-400 |
| Sonoita/Elgin | ~500-600 | ~55-65% | ~300-380 |
| **Total** | **~1,050-1,250** | | **~630-780** |

**Realistic D target:** If Ramirez can win 55-65% of votes in these precincts (achievable given registration and issue alignment), that's ~350-500 votes. In a race where every vote matters in a R+19 district, these are important but not sufficient on their own.
