It is named after Cochise, a Chiricahua Apache, who was a key war leader during the Apache Wars.\nIts population was 125,447 at the 2020 census. The county seat is Bisbee and the most populous city is Sierra Vista.\nCochise County includes the Sierra Vista-Douglas, Arizona metropolitan statistical area. The county borders southwestern New Mexico and the northwestern Mexican state of Sonora.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIn 1528, Spanish explorers \u00c1lvar N\u00fa\u00f1ez Cabeza de Vaca, Estevanico, and Fray Marcos de Niza survived a shipwreck off the Texas coast. Captured by Native Americans, they spent eight years finding their way back to Mexico City, via the San Pedro Valley. Their journals, maps, and stories led to the Cibola, seven cities of gold myth. The Expedition of Francisco V\u00e1squez de Coronado in 1539 using it as his route north through what they called the Guachuca Mountains of Pima (Tohono O'odham) lands and later part of the mission routes north, but was actually occupied by the Sobaipuri descendants of the Hohokam. They found a large Pueblo (described as a small city) between modern Benson and Whetstone, and several smaller satellite villages and smaller pueblos including ones on Fort Huachuca, Huachuca City, and North Eastern Fry. About 1657, Father Kino visited the Sobaipuris just before the Apache forced most from the valley, as they were struggling to survive due to increasing Chiricahua Apache attacks as they moved into the area of Texas Canyon of the Dragoon Mountains. In 1775, Presidio Santa Cruz de Terrenate was founded on the west bank of the San Pedro River to protect the natives and the Mexican settlers who supplied the mission stations. The presidio was chronically short on provisions due to raids, however, and lacked personnel to adequately patrol the eastern route due to wars with France and England, so the main route north shifted west to the Santa Cruz Valley, farther from the range of the Chiricahua Apache, who almost exclusively controlled the area by 1821.\n\nCochise County was created on February 1, 1881, out of the eastern portion of Pima County. It took its name from the Chiricahua Apache war chief Cochise.  The county seat was Tombstone until 1929, when it moved to Bisbee. Notable men who once held the position of county sheriff were Johnny Behan, who served as the first sheriff of the new county, and who was one of the main characters during the events leading to and following the gunfight at the O.K. Corral. Later, in 1886, Texas John Slaughter became sheriff. Lawman Jeff Milton and lawman/outlaw Burt Alvord both served as deputies under Slaughter.\nA syndicated television series that aired from 1956 to 1958, The Sheriff of Cochise starring John Bromfield, was filmed on location in Cochise County. The Jimmy Stewart movie Broken Arrow and subsequent television show of the same name starring John Lupton, which also aired from 1956 to 1958, were set in Cochise County, but filmed at other locations.\nJ.A. Jance's Joanna Brady mystery series takes place in Cochise County, where Brady is sheriff.\nBeginning in the late 1950s, the small community of Miracle Valley was the site of a series of bible colleges and similar religious organizations, founded by television evangelist A. A. Allen. In 1982, Miracle Valley and neighboring Palominas were the site of a series of escalating conflicts between a newly arrived black religious community and the county sheriff and deputies that culminated in the Miracle Valley shootout.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 6,219 square miles (16,110 km2), of which 53 square miles (140 km2) (0.9%) are covered by water.

Although the county includes the relatively liberal town of Bisbee, as well as the city of Douglas which has a large Latino population, this is outweighed by the heavily Republican tilt of the more populous Sierra Vista, which is adjacent to Fort Huachuca and thus has a heavy military presence.\n\nIn the United States House of Representatives, the county is mostly part of Arizona's 6th congressional district, which is represented by Republican Juan Ciscomani.
