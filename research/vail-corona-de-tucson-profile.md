## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Vail and Corona de Tucson are the **wealthiest and fastest-growing communities in LD-19**. Together they represent ~25,000 residents and an estimated 15-20% of the district electorate. Both are unincorporated CDPs governed by Pima County. Vail rejected incorporation for the **third time** in November 2023 (Prop 402 failed 62-38%). These communities are suburban, affluent, family-oriented, and conservative-leaning but with a large independent voter bloc. The defining institutions are Vail Unified School District (one of the best in southern AZ) and the Rocking K master-planned community (4,000+ homes at build-out). **Corona de Tucson is significantly wealthier than previously estimated** — its $127,743 median household income actually exceeds Vail's $121,385.

**Campaign Significance:** These communities cannot be won by a Democrat but can be **margin-narrowed**. Pima County District 4 (which covers both) registered R 36% / D 31% / I 33% — tighter than the LD-19 average. Supervisor Steve Christy (R) won re-election by only ~5,097 votes in 2024. CD-6 (Juan Ciscomani) is a Cook PVI EVEN swing district. This is not deep-red territory — it's persuadable suburban territory.

| **AZ Rank** | 50th of 445 CDPs/cities | — |

**Key Correction:** Corona de Tucson is substantially larger than the 7,450 previously estimated. At 9,240 (2020 Census), it had the **highest growth rate in the Tucson MSA** at 62.8% from 2010-2020. Combined, these two communities have ~25,000 residents — roughly 11% of the entire LD-19 population.

### 1B. Age Distribution

| Metric | Vail | Corona de Tucson |
|--------|------|------------------|
| **Median Age** | **39.9** | **37.5** |

## 3. GOVERNANCE

### 3A. Unincorporated Status — Pima County Governance

| Position | Name | Party | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|-------|
| **Pima County Supervisor, District 4** | **Steve Christy** | **R** | 3rd term (re-elected Nov 2024) |
| **2024 Challenger** | Vanessa Bechtol | D | Lost ~52.3% to ~47.7% (margin: ~5,097 votes) |
| **Board Status** | Christy is **sole Republican** on Pima County BOS | | Board is 4D-1R |

**District 4 Voter Registration:** R 36% / D 31% / I 33%

### 3B. THE INCORPORATION VOTE — November 7, 2023

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Ballot Measure** | Proposition 402 |
| **Result** | **FAILED — 62% NO / 38% YES** |
| **Margin** | 24 percentage points against |
| **Attempt Number** | 3rd (prior failures: 1995, 2013) |
| **2013 Result** | Failed 55-45 (erosion of support) |
| **Pro-incorporation spending** | ~$250,000 over multi-year campaign |
| **Pro-incorporation org** | Incorporate Vail Arizona / Love Vail. Vote Vail! |
| **Anti-incorporation org** | Vote NO 402 |

**Arguments FOR:** Local control over zoning/development, access to state-shared revenue, autonomy over growth. Endorsed by Tucson Metro Chamber.

**Arguments AGAINST:** Higher taxes, redundant services, would promote more growth, rushed process, divisive. Tax concern was decisive.

**Will it return?** Probably not before 2028+. The 24-point loss was worse than 2013's 10-point loss — support is declining, not growing. But underlying pressures (growth, infrastructure) persist.

### 3C. Vail Unified School District (VUSD)

| Metric | Verified Value |
|--------|---------------|
| **Superintendent** | **John Carruth** (appointed Nov 2019; AZ Superintendent of the Year, Large Districts) |
| **Total Schools** | **24** (1 preschool, 10 elementary, 6 middle, 5 high schools, plus Vail Academy K-12) |
| **Enrollment (2024-25)** | **~14,831 students** |
| **Growth** | Gaining 20-50 students per school; half of K-8/middle schools growing |
| **AZ Report Cards Rank** | 61 out of 289 districts |
| **SchoolDigger** | 4-star overall |
| **Top Schools** | Empire High (5-star, top in state), Esmond Station (5-star), Senita Valley Elementary (5-star) |
| **New School** | **Saguaro Creek K-8** opening in Rocking K, July 2025 |
| **Notable** | Growing despite statewide ESA voucher availability |

**Campaign Relevance:** VUSD is THE civic institution in Vail. School board members, PTA leaders, and education advocates are the informal power structure. Education quality is a winning issue here — these parents moved here for the schools.

### 3D. Other Governance

| Entity | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Fire** | Rincon Valley Fire District (Vail); Corona de Tucson Fire District |
| **Water** | Vail Water Company (private), private wells on rural parcels |
| **Law Enforcement** | Pima County Sheriff's Department (no local police) |
| **Federal** | AZ DPS on I-10; Border Patrol checkpoints |

## 4. POLITICAL PROFILE

### 4A. The Political Landscape

| Level | Representative | Party | Notes |
|-------|---------------|-------|-------|
| **U.S. House (CD-6)** | **Juan Ciscomani** | R | Re-elected 2024 by ~7,900 votes; **Cook PVI: EVEN** (true swing) |
| **AZ State Senate (LD-17)** | Vince Leach | R | Elected 2024 |
| **AZ State House (LD-17)** | Kevin Volk, Rachel Keshel | R, R | Both elected 2024 |
| **Pima County Supervisor (D4)** | Steve Christy | R | Won by ~5,097 votes (52.3-47.7%) |

**CRITICAL NOTE:** Vail/Corona de Tucson are in **LD-17** for state legislative purposes, NOT LD-19. They are included in this research because they are part of the LD-19 community research universe for a district-wide campaign strategy, but their state-level representatives are different. **Verify which specific precincts fall in LD-19 vs LD-17.**

**UPDATE NEEDED:** If these communities are actually in LD-17, they vote for different state legislators. However, the Pima County precincts that ARE in LD-19 (possibly southern portions around Green Valley/Sahuarita) would still be relevant. This geographic boundary needs to be confirmed with the AIRC maps.

### 4B. Voter Registration

| Geography | R | D | I/Other |
|-----------|---|---|---------|
| **Pima County District 4** | **36%** | **31%** | **33%** |
| **LD-19 overall** | 43% | 24% | 33% |

District 4 is notably less Republican than LD-19 overall. The 5-point R-D gap (vs. 19-point gap in LD-19) reflects the Tucson metro suburban environment.

### 4C. How Conservative?

**Conservative, but a specific kind of conservative:**

1. **Fiscally conservative** — The incorporation vote proved this decisively (3x)
2. **Pro-education** — Willing to fund schools through bonds (separates them from hard-right)
3. **Moderate on social issues** — Educated suburban voters; not reliably culture-war voters
4. **Growth-skeptical** — Concerned about managed growth and community character
5. **Pro-law enforcement** — Suburban safety voters
6. **Military-connected** — Patriotic but not uniformly partisan

**The Vail voter archetype:** A 40-year-old Raytheon engineer or UA administrator with two kids in Vail schools, a $400K house, two cars, and a 30-minute commute. Registered Republican or Independent. Primarily concerned about property values, school quality, traffic, and taxes. Will split their ticket if given a compelling reason — Ciscomani's narrow CD-6 win and Christy's narrow D4 win suggest this is happening.

### 4D. 2024 Election Data

Trump improved margins in **165 of 266 Pima County precincts** vs. 2020. Biggest improvements on South Side near Davis-Monthan. Vail-specific precinct data requires download from: [Pima County Elections](https://www.pima.gov/2865/Election-Results)

## 5. KEY ISSUES

### 5A. Growth Management and Development (PRIMARY ISSUE)

The defining issue. Residential development outpaces infrastructure (roads, water, schools, commercial). Pima County zoning authority means residents have limited input. Rocking K's 4,000-home build-out will transform the area. Current residents moved here for open space that new development is eliminating.

**Campaign angle:** This is where a Democrat can outflank Republicans. Conservative county supervisors have been developer-friendly. A candidate arguing for community voice in development, controlled growth, and infrastructure-first planning speaks directly to Vail concerns without triggering partisan reflexes.

### 5B. Traffic and Transportation
- I-10 congestion worsening with growth
- Houghton Road corridor strained
- No public transit (SunTran doesn't reach Vail)
- 100% car-dependent

### 5C. Water Sustainability
- Groundwater-dependent, Tucson Active Management Area
- 2025 "safe yield" goal not met
- Thousands of new homes requiring water hookups
- Climate change reducing recharge

### 5D. School Capacity
- VUSD building new schools (Saguaro Creek K-8 opening 2025) but enrollment is growing
- Bond measures have passed — community supports schools
- Teacher recruitment challenge (cost of living vs. pay)

### 5E. Healthcare Access
- **No hospital in Vail or Corona de Tucson**
- Nearest ERs: Banner-UMC South (~20 min), TMC (~25 min)
- Growing population increases emergency service demand

### 5F. Wildfire Risk
- Rincon Mountains/desert grasslands are fire-prone
- WUI zones expanding with development
- Insurance costs rising

## 6. COMMUNITY ASSETS

### Natural/Recreational
| Asset | Type |
|-------|------|
| **Colossal Cave Mountain Park** | 2,400 acres, cave tours, horseback riding, camping; 2025 TripAdvisor Travelers' Choice Award (top 10% worldwide); operated by Ortega Family Enterprises |
| **Cienega Creek Natural Preserve** | 4,000+ acres, one of last perennial streams in southern AZ |
| **Saguaro National Park (Rincon District)** | National Park borders Vail |
| **Arizona Trail** | Passes through area |
| **Empire Mountains** | BLM land, open space |

### Schools (VUSD — 24 campuses)
Top-rated: Empire High (5-star), Cienega High, Esmond Station (5-star), Senita Valley Elementary (5-star), Vail Academy K-12

### Media
| Outlet | Type |
|--------|------|
| Arizona Daily Star | Tucson metro newspaper |
| The Vail Voice | Community online publication |
| KOLD / KVOA / KGUN | Tucson TV |
| Nextdoor / Facebook groups | Very active community forums |

## 7. STRATEGIC ASSESSMENT

### 7A. Messaging Opportunities

| Issue | Message Frame | Resonance |
|-------|--------------|-----------|
| Growth management | "Your community, your voice — not developer decisions" | **HIGH** |
| School funding | "Protect what makes Vail schools great" | **HIGH** |
| Water | "No water, no future — sustainable growth now" | **HIGH** |
| Infrastructure | "Roads and services before more rooftops" | **HIGH** |
| Property taxes | "Keep your taxes low AND your services strong" | MEDIUM-HIGH |
| Healthcare | "An ER shouldn't be 30 minutes away" | MEDIUM |

### 7B. Messaging Risks

| Topic | Risk |
|-------|------|
| Taxation | Any hint of tax increases triggers reflexes |
| Gun control | Deeply unpopular |
| "Democrat" label | Lead with issues, not party |
| Tucson comparisons | "Don't make us like Tucson" is real |
| Incorporation | Don't reopen this wound |

### 7C. Voter Math

**Estimated registered voters:** ~15,000-16,500 combined
**% of LD-19 total vote:** ~15-20%

A Democrat doesn't need to WIN Vail. The goal is **margin-narrowing**. Getting R+25 down to R+15 while winning bigger in favorable precincts is the strategy. Christy's 52.3-47.7% win shows this electorate CAN be close.

## 8. DATA GAPS — STILL NEEDED

| Priority | Data Point | Source |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| **CRITICAL** | Confirm which Vail/CdT precincts are in LD-19 vs LD-17 | AIRC district maps |
| **HIGH** | 2024 precinct-level results for Vail/Corona precincts | Pima County Recorder |
| **HIGH** | Gallego vs. Harris performance differential in these precincts | Pima County election data |
| **MEDIUM** | VUSD governing board members | VUSD website |
| **MEDIUM** | Rincon Valley Fire District board/budget | District website |
| **LOW** | Community organizations inventory | Local websites |
