## THE THREE DISTRICTS WITHIN LD-19

LD-19 is not one district. It's three fundamentally different regions stitched together by redistricting.

### Region 1: Mining/Rural Northeast (Graham + Greenlee Counties)
**Population:** ~50,000 | **Character:** Working-class, extraction economy | **Lean:** R+40-45

| Community | Pop | MHI | Key Fact |
|-----------|-----|-----|----------|
| Safford | 10,257 | $65,727 | County seat, 47% Hispanic, median age 31.3 |
| Thatcher | 5,627 | $77,455 | LDS-influenced, first female mayor (Jenny Howard, 2024) |
| Clifton | 3,912 | ~$45,000 | County seat, 65-75% Hispanic, mining town |
| Morenci | 2,028 | ~$70,000 | Freeport company town, NO elected government |
| Duncan | 689 | ~$35,000 | Farming, isolated, highest poverty |

**Defining Issues:** Water rights (Gila River adjudication threatens 30,000 acres), mining dependency, poverty amid extraction ($1.7B GDP but last in per-capita income), no hospital in Greenlee County

**Political Goldmine:** Graham County Supervisor **Paul David is a Democrat** in deep-red territory. Greenlee County has a **Democratic BOS chairman (David Gomez)**, two **Independent supervisors**, and elected the **first Independent sheriff in Arizona history (Eric Ellison)** in 2024. This is NOT solid Republican territory at the local level.

### Region 2: Military/Ranching Central (Cochise County)
**Population:** ~125,000 | **Character:** Military-dependent, suburban-rural mix | **Lean:** R+17-23

| Community | Pop | MHI | Key Fact |
|-----------|-----|-----|----------|
| Sierra Vista | 44,710 | $69,783 | Largest city, 24.2% veterans, Fort Huachuca |
| Benson | 5,355 | $42,120 | Active recall crisis, 18.4% poverty |
| Willcox | 3,700 | ~$38,000 | Wine country, pistachio farming |
| Huachuca City | 1,800 | ~$45,000 | All-female council except mayor |
| Tombstone | 1,300 | ~$32,000 | Tourism, ~500K visitors/year |

**Defining Issues:** Fort Huachuca ($2.9B economic impact, Oct 2025 government shutdown furloughed 4,000+), water crisis (San Pedro River overdraft, 55 subdivisions' water designations challenged), border proximity (15 mi from Mexico), healthcare (specialty care requires 75-mi Tucson trip)

**Political Reality:** Cochise County BOS is now **all-Republican** (Ann English-D lost her seat). Sheriff Mark Dannels is a border security hawk. But Cochise County gave Democrats 40.2% in the Senate race (Gallego). Gallego outperformed Harris by 2.5 points here. The military community is educated, pragmatic, and splits tickets.

### Region 3: Suburban/Retirement Southwest (Pima + Santa Cruz portions)
**Population:** ~55,000 | **Character:** Affluent suburban + retirement | **Lean:** R+5-10 (tightest!)

| Community | Pop | MHI | Key Fact |
|-----------|-----|-----|----------|
| Green Valley | 21,581 | $58,268 | Median age 73.3, hospital CLOSED (2022), 83.7% on Social Security |
| Vail | 15,722 | $121,385 | Fastest growing, rejected incorporation 3x |
| Corona de Tucson | 9,240 | $127,743 | Wealthiest community in district |
| Patagonia | 800 | ~$38,000 | Progressive arts community |
| Sonoita/Elgin | ~900 | ~$55,000 | Wine region, 15 active wineries |

**Defining Issues:** Growth management (Rocking K: 4,000 homes at build-out), water sustainability, hospital closure devastating Green Valley seniors, **Copper World mine fully permitted** (galvanizing opposition in Patagonia/Sonoita), school quality (VUSD is top-rated)

**Political Opportunity:** Pima County District 4 registration is R 36% / D 31% / I 33% — only 5-point gap. Supervisor Steve Christy (R) won by just 5,097 votes. CD-6 (Ciscomani) is Cook PVI EVEN. Santa Cruz BOS is **all-Democrat**. This is genuine swing territory.

## ELECTORAL MATH

### The Hard Numbers

| What's Needed | Math |
|---------------|------|
| **House win (1 of 2 seats)** | ~34% in a 2R+1D race = ~57,000 votes |
| **Senate win** | ~50.1% in a 2-person race = ~57,000 votes |
| **2024 Dem House votes** | 42,468 (25.4%) |
| **2024 Dem Senate votes** | 42,555 (37.4%) |
| **Gap to House win** | ~14,500 votes / +8.6 points |
| **Gap to Senate win** | ~14,500 votes / +12.7 points |

### The Proof of Concept

| Evidence | What It Proves |
|----------|---------------|
| Frostrom got 42,468 votes with **zero** state party support | The floor is 25% House / 37% Senate with NOTHING |
| Gallego outperformed Harris by 2-4 pts in every county | Ticket-splitting is real and exploitable |
| Kelly outperformed Biden by 2-7 pts across all counties (2020) | Military candidates can dramatically overperform party brand |
| Greenlee elects Dems and Independents to local office | Republican dominance is shallow, not deep |
| Christy (R) won Pima D4 by only 5,097 votes | The southwest corner is genuinely competitive |
| **Jackie Anderson + Aiden Swallow** were at Cochise Dems Dec 2025 meeting | Other Democrats are already running for 2026 |

### The 33% Path

| Voter Group | Registration | Needed D Share | Votes |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|-------|
| Democrats (24%) | ~27,000 | 90% | 24,300 |
| Independents (33%) | ~38,000 | 60% | 22,800 |
| Republicans (43%) | ~49,000 | 7% | 3,430 |
| **TOTAL** | | | **50,530** |

At 2022 midterm turnout (~61%), total votes cast would be ~70,000. Need ~35,000+ for House win. This is achievable IF Independent capture is strong and Dem turnout is maximized.

## ISSUE MATRIX — What Resonates Where

| Issue | Sierra Vista | Green Valley | Safford | Vail | Greenlee | Patagonia |
|-------|-------------|-------------|---------|------|----------|-----------|
| **Water** | HIGH (San Pedro) | HIGH (declining table) | CRITICAL (Gila adjudication) | HIGH (growth) | MEDIUM | HIGH (Copper World) |
| **Healthcare** | MED (specialty gap) | CRITICAL (hospital closed!) | MED (only hospital in region) | MED (no local ER) | CRITICAL (no hospital) | HIGH (no local care) |
| **Economy/Jobs** | HIGH (Fort Huachuca) | LOW (retirement) | HIGH (poverty amid wealth) | LOW (commuter) | HIGH (mine dependency) | MED (tourism economy) |
| **Military/BRAC** | CRITICAL | LOW | LOW | LOW | LOW | LOW |
| **Mining** | LOW | LOW | HIGH (Freeport) | LOW | CRITICAL | HIGH (Copper World) |
| **Education** | HIGH (SVUSD struggling) | LOW | HIGH (EAC, K-12) | HIGH (VUSD pride) | MED | MED |
| **Growth/Dev** | MED | LOW (built out) | LOW | CRITICAL | LOW | HIGH (mine threat) |
| **Border** | HIGH (15 mi) | MED | LOW | LOW | LOW | MED (20 mi) |
| **Housing** | HIGH (BAH distortion) | MED | MED | HIGH (affordability) | CRITICAL (company town) | HIGH (locals priced out) |

### Universal Issues (resonate everywhere)
1. **Water** — Every community faces water insecurity. This transcends party.
2. **Healthcare access** — Hospital deserts, specialist shortages, long drive times.
3. **Cost of living** — Even affluent communities feel inflation pressure.

### Community-Specific Winning Messages

| Community | Lead Message |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Sierra Vista** | "Protecting Fort Huachuca means protecting your livelihood" |
| **Green Valley** | "You deserve a hospital. You lost yours. I'll fight to bring healthcare back." |
| **Safford/Thatcher** | "Your water feeds your farms. No corporation should take it." |
| **Vail** | "Your schools are great. Let's make sure they stay that way." |
| **Greenlee** | "For 84 years, mining families voted for the party that stood with workers. I'm here to earn that trust back." |
| **Patagonia/Sonoita** | "This valley is worth protecting — from mines that don't belong here." |
| **Benson** | "Your town deserves transparent government. Period." (recall crisis) |

## GOVERNANCE POWER MAP

### Who Matters Most (Allies/Targets)

| Person | Role | Party | Why They Matter |
|--------|------|-------|----------------|
| **Paul David** | Graham County Supervisor D1 | **D** | Dem winning in deep-red territory — study his playbook |
| **David Gomez** | Greenlee County BOS Chair | **D** | 5-term Dem in mining country; won recount in 2024 |
| **Eric Ellison** | Greenlee County Sheriff | **I** | First Independent sheriff in AZ history — populist appeal |
| **Jenny Howard** | Thatcher Mayor | **?** | First female mayor in 109 years — symbol of change |
| **Steve Christy** | Pima County Supervisor D4 | R | Won by only 5,097 — his territory is swing |
| **John Fanning** | Santa Cruz County Supervisor D3 | **D** | New, covers Patagonia/Sonoita area |
| **Rudy Molera** | Santa Cruz County Supervisor D2 | **D** | 5th term, institutional knowledge |
| **Gail Griffin** | State Rep | R | 16+ years, "water expert" — her Water 101 meeting drew protests |
| **Lupe Diaz** | State Rep | R | Based in Benson, where recall crisis is erupting |

### Cochise County BOS — ALL REPUBLICAN Now

| District | Supervisor | Party |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| D1 | Tom Crosby | R |
| D2 | Kathleen Gomez | R (replaced Ann English-D) |
| D3 | Frank Antenori | R (replaced Peggy Judd-R) |

The loss of Ann English as the lone Democrat on the Cochise County BOS is significant. No natural Democratic ally remains in Cochise County governance.

## CRITICAL INTELLIGENCE FINDINGS

### 1. The Frostrom Proof
Gregg Frostrom Jr. (Army vet, MBA, clinical researcher) got **42,468 votes (25.4%)** in the House race with:
- Zero state party funding
- Zero ADLCC investment
- Party actively abandoned the race
- Local activists attempted "bullet vote" strategy without support

**This is the baseline with NOTHING. The ceiling with a real campaign is genuinely unknown.**

### 2. The 2026 Democratic Field
The Cochise County Democrats hosted **Jackie Anderson and Aiden Swallow** at a December 6, 2025 meeting as "LD-19 candidates." This means Ramirez is potentially entering a contested primary or a multi-candidate field.

### 3. Green Valley's Hospital Crisis
Santa Cruz Valley Regional Hospital closed June 30, 2022 under private equity ownership. **100,000 people along I-19 lost their only hospital.** No reopening date. This is the single most potent local issue in the district's southwest corner. A candidate who makes this their signature issue in Green Valley has a built-in audience.

### 4. Greenlee County Is NOT Solid Red
- BOS: 1 Democrat (chair) + 2 Independents + 0 Republicans
- Sheriff: Independent (defeated R and D candidates)
- This county that voted D from 1912-1996 still has Democratic DNA. The infrastructure just needs to be rebuilt.

### 5. The Benson Recall
Four of six Benson council members face **recall elections on May 19, 2026** over an aluminum recycling plant controversy, including a fake Facebook profile scandal. This is happening in Lupe Diaz's hometown. Political chaos = opportunity for outside attention.

### 6. Copper World Mine — Fully Permitted
Hudbay Minerals received all three state permits for the Copper World copper mine near Patagonia by January 2025. Feasibility study completes first half 2026. Active litigation continues (Save the Scenic Santa Ritas). Opposition is bipartisan — ranchers, environmentalists, tourism businesses. This is THE galvanizing issue for Santa Cruz County voters.

### 7. Fort Huachuca Government Shutdown
The October 2025 federal government shutdown furloughed 4,000+ civilian workers at Fort Huachuca. Businesses reported double-digit revenue drops. 30% of the electric cooperative's customers work at the fort. This is a live wound in Sierra Vista that demonstrates federal dependency risk.

## RECOMMENDED CANVASSING PRIORITY

Based on voter density, persuadability, and issue alignment:

| Priority | Area | Registered Voters (est.) | Strategy |
|----------|------|-------------------------|----------|
| **1** | Sierra Vista | ~25,000-28,000 | Military families, veterans, healthcare messaging |
| **2** | Green Valley | ~15,000-17,000 | Hospital closure, Medicare, water, senior turnout |
| **3** | Vail/Corona de Tucson | ~15,000-16,500 | Margin-narrowing: schools, growth, water |
| **4** | Safford/Thatcher | ~8,000-10,000 | Water rights, poverty, economic development |
| **5** | Benson/Willcox area | ~5,000-7,000 | Healthcare, water, local governance |
| **6** | Clifton/Morenci | ~3,500-4,500 | Worker rights, healthcare, mine accountability |
| **7** | Patagonia/Sonoita | ~1,500-2,000 | Copper World mine, environment, water |

**The 100-door-per-day math:**
- 100 doors/day x 90 campaign days = 9,000 doors
- Focus 60% on Sierra Vista + Green Valley (5,400 doors in the two highest-value areas)
- Focus 25% on Vail + Safford (2,250 doors)
- Focus 15% on everywhere else (1,350 doors)

## WHAT'S STILL MISSING

| Priority | Data Gap | How to Get It |
|----------|----------|---------------|
| **CRITICAL** | Precinct-level 2024 results (all 5 counties) | Download from county recorder offices |
| **CRITICAL** | Prop 139 (abortion) results by precinct | Same sources — reveals crossover potential |
| **CRITICAL** | Confirm Vail/CdT are in LD-19 or LD-17 | Check AIRC district maps |
| **HIGH** | Who are Jackie Anderson and Aiden Swallow? | Contact Cochise County Dems |
| **HIGH** | Green Valley Democrats club — does it exist? | Web search + outreach |
| **HIGH** | Exact Santa Cruz 2024 presidential results | County recorder |
| **MEDIUM** | Voter file analysis (precinct-level registration) | AZ SOS voter file |
| **MEDIUM** | Campaign finance (who funds Griffin/Diaz/Gowan?) | Follow the Money |
| **MEDIUM** | Greenlee County voter registration R/D/I split | County recorder |

---

## BOTTOM LINE

LD-19 is classified as "outside competitive range" by the AIRC. The registration gap is R+19. But the data tells a more nuanced story:

1. **A Democrat has never been seriously tested here.** The state party abandoned every candidate. The ceiling is genuinely unknown.
2. **The 33% Independent bloc is the path.** These are not ideological Republicans — they're persuadable on economic, healthcare, and quality-of-life issues.
3. **The district is three different campaigns.** Mining northeast, military central, suburban-retirement southwest. Each requires tailored messaging.
4. **The issues favor Democrats.** Water, healthcare access, hospital closures, worker rights, education — these are all Democratic-favorable if framed as community issues, not partisan ones.
5. **Greenlee County's Democratic heritage is real and ongoing.** A Democratic BOS chairman, Independent supervisors and sheriff — the local infrastructure is alive.
6. **The military vote is not locked-in Republican.** Kelly (+6.6 in Greenlee, +2.1 in Cochise) and Gallego (+2.5 in Cochise) prove military communities will vote for the right Democrat.

**The question is not whether LD-19 can be won. The question is whether anyone has ever seriously tried.**
