## 1. STATE LEGISLATURE (LD-19)

### Current Configuration (57th Arizona Legislature, 2025-2026)

LD-19 is classified by the Arizona Independent Redistricting Commission as **"outside of competitive range and leaning Republican."** The district spans 5 counties: all of Greenlee, and parts of Graham, Cochise, Pima, and Santa Cruz counties.

**Voter Registration (Nov 2024):** R 43% | D 24% | I/Other 33%

---

### SENATE: David Gowan (R)

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Full Name** | David M. Gowan Sr. |
| **Party** | Republican |
| **District** | LD-19 |
| **Residence** | Sierra Vista, AZ |
| **Current Role** | State Senator |
| **Previous Roles** | AZ House of Representatives (LD-14/LD-30), Speaker of the House (2015-2016) |
| **First Elected to Legislature** | 2010 (House), moved to Senate after redistricting |
| **Military** | U.S. Army veteran (retired) |

**Background:**
- David Gowan served in the Arizona House of Representatives before moving to the Senate. He was notably **Speaker of the Arizona House** during the 2015-2016 session, making him one of the most powerful legislators in recent Arizona history.
- Army veteran, which connects to the Fort Huachuca military community in Sierra Vista.
- Ran unsuccessfully for Congress (CD-2) in 2020 Republican primary, losing to Brandon Martin.
- Known as a strong conservative voice, pro-military, pro-border security.

**Committee Assignments:** [VERIFY for 57th Legislature]
- Likely serving on Appropriations, Government, or Military Affairs-related committees
- Previously chaired committees related to government operations

**Key Voting Record Highlights:**
- Consistently pro-mining, pro-business regulatory environment
- Supported tax cuts and business-friendly legislation
- Pro-gun, A-rated by NRA
- Opposed expansion of Medicaid
- Strong border security advocate
- Has not championed rural healthcare expansion or water protection legislation (vulnerability)

**Term Limits Analysis:**
- Arizona state senators are limited to **4 consecutive terms** (8 years) under Prop 106 (2000).
- However, Gowan has served in both chambers. His Senate clock started when he first won the Senate seat for the post-2022 redistricting cycle.
- [VERIFY] If Gowan's current Senate term began in 2023 (post-redistricting), he could theoretically serve through 2030 (4 terms).
- **Practical question:** Is he termed out of the Senate by 2026 or 2028? This depends on exactly when his consecutive Senate service began. His prior House service does NOT count against Senate term limits.

### HOUSE: Gail Griffin (R)

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Full Name** | Gail Griffin |
| **Party** | Republican |
| **District** | LD-19 |
| **Residence** | Hereford, AZ (Cochise County) |
| **Current Role** | State Representative |
| **Previous Roles** | State Senator (LD-14, then LD-19), served in Senate 2011-2022 |
| **First Elected to Legislature** | 2008 (Senate, LD-25, appointed), elected in own right 2010 |
| **Career Before Politics** | Rancher, businesswoman |

**Background:**
- Gail Griffin is one of the **longest-serving** legislators in LD-19's territory. She was first appointed to the State Senate in 2008 and was elected in 2010. She served in the Senate through 2022 (including as chair of powerful committees).
- After being **termed out of the Senate** following the 2022 redistricting cycle, she moved to the **House** starting with the 2023 session (57th Legislature / post-redistricting).
- She is the most powerful and entrenched Republican in the district. Her institutional knowledge, committee relationships, and donor network make her the de facto Republican power broker.
- Known as the legislature's foremost water policy expert -- but critics say her water positions favor industrial and mining users over residential wells and rural homeowners.

**How Long Has She Served?**
- **Total legislative service: approximately 16+ years** (2008-present)
- Senate: 2008-2022 (~14 years, including appointment)
- House: 2023-present (current term)
- She is among the longest-serving current members of the Arizona Legislature.

**Committee Assignments:** [VERIFY for current session]
- Historically chaired Senate Natural Resources, Energy & Water Committee (extremely powerful position for LD-19 interests)
- Likely serves on Natural Resources/Water, Commerce, or Government committees in the House
- Her water policy chairmanship gave her enormous influence over mining, agriculture, and rural development legislation

**Key Voting Record Highlights:**
- **Water Policy:** Has championed legislation protecting large-scale pumping rights (mining, agriculture) while blocking stronger protections for residential wells and small rural users. This is a KEY vulnerability -- her water votes can be framed as choosing Freeport-McMoRan over family wells.
- **Mining:** Consistently pro-mining, supported tax exemptions and regulatory relief for mining companies
- **Environment:** Opposed environmental regulations that would constrain mining or agriculture
- **Gun Rights:** Strong 2A supporter
- **Immigration/Border:** Hawkish border security positions
- **Healthcare:** Has not championed rural healthcare expansion despite Greenlee County having no hospital

**2024 House Results:**
- Griffin (R): **31,444 votes (39.6%)**
- Combined with Diaz, Republicans took 76.3% of the total vote

**Term Limits Analysis:**
- Since Griffin moved from Senate to House, her House term limit clock **reset**. She can serve up to 4 consecutive terms (8 years) in the House.
- If her first House term began in 2023, she is eligible to serve through **2030** (terms ending 2024, 2026, 2028, 2030).
- She is **NOT termed out for 2026**. She can run again.
- [VERIFY] Confirm her exact term limit expiration.

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Full Name** | Lupe Diaz |
| **Party** | Republican |
| **District** | LD-19 |
| **Residence** | Benson, AZ (Cochise County) |
| **Current Role** | State Representative |
| **First Elected** | 2022 (took office January 2023, 56th Legislature) |
| **Background** | [VERIFY] Law enforcement / public safety background reported |

**Background:**
- Lupe Diaz is the **newer** member of the LD-19 delegation, first elected in the **2022 general election** (taking office in January 2023 for the 56th Legislature under the new redistricting maps).
- Based in Benson, Cochise County.
- Less publicly prominent than Griffin or Gowan. Lower profile, fewer legislative accomplishments to date.
- Hispanic Republican -- notable in a district that is significantly Hispanic (especially in the mining communities and border areas).

**2024 House Results:**
- Diaz (R): **29,143 votes (36.7%)**
- Ran behind Griffin by ~2,300 votes, suggesting Griffin has stronger personal brand/name recognition.

**Committee Assignments:** [VERIFY]
- Likely junior committee assignments given recent election

**Term Limits Analysis:**
- First term began 2023. Can serve 4 consecutive House terms through **2030**.
- **NOT termed out for 2026.** Can run again.

### Term Limits Summary Table

| Legislator | Chamber | First Term (Current Chamber) | Termed Out After | Can Run in 2026? |
|------------|---------|------------------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| David Gowan (R) | Senate | [VERIFY: 2023 or earlier] | [VERIFY: 2026-2030] | [VERIFY] |
| Gail Griffin (R) | House | 2023 | ~2030 | YES |

## 2. U.S. CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION

### Congressional District Overlap

After the 2022 redistricting, LD-19 is primarily overlapped by:

| U.S. House District | Representative | Overlap with LD-19 |
|---------------------|----------------|---------------------|
| **AZ CD-6** | Juan Ciscomani (R) | **Primary overlap** -- Cochise County, southeastern Pima County (Vail, Green Valley area), Santa Cruz County portions |
| **AZ CD-2** | Eli Crane (R) | **Partial overlap** -- Graham County, Greenlee County, northeastern portions |

> [VERIFY] The exact CD boundaries relative to LD-19 should be confirmed with the Arizona redistricting maps. The mining communities (Morenci/Clifton/Safford) are in CD-2, while the Cochise County and southern Pima County portions are in CD-6.

---

### AZ CD-6: Juan Ciscomani (R)

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Full Name** | Juan Ciscomani |
| **Party** | Republican |
| **District** | AZ-6 (southeastern Arizona, including Tucson suburbs) |
| **Residence** | Tucson, AZ |
| **First Elected** | 2022 |
| **Re-elected** | 2024 (narrowly, one of the closest races in the country) |
| **Background** | Former aide to Governor Doug Ducey, Mexican immigrant, education policy |
| **Key Issues** | Border security, immigration reform, education, military support |
| **Committees** | [VERIFY for 119th Congress] Appropriations Committee |

**Relevance to LD-19:** Ciscomani represents the Sierra Vista / Fort Huachuca area, Green Valley, Vail, Benson, Tombstone, and the Cochise County portions of LD-19. He narrowly won re-election in 2024, making this a **competitive swing seat** even though the state legislative district is solidly Republican.

---

### AZ CD-2: Eli Crane (R)

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Full Name** | Elijah "Eli" Crane |
| **Party** | Republican |
| **District** | AZ-2 (rural northern and eastern Arizona) |
| **Residence** | Oro Valley, AZ (previously Tucson area) |
| **First Elected** | 2022 (defeated incumbent Tom O'Halleran, D) |
| **Re-elected** | 2024 |
| **Background** | Former Navy SEAL, small business owner (Bottle Breacher) |
| **Key Issues** | Border security, limited government, veterans, anti-establishment |
| **Committees** | [VERIFY for 119th Congress] Homeland Security, Small Business |

**Relevance to LD-19:** Crane represents the Graham County (Safford/Thatcher) and Greenlee County (Morenci/Clifton) portions of LD-19 -- the mining and agricultural communities. His district is one of the largest in the country by area.

---

### U.S. SENATORS (Statewide)

| Senator | Party | First Elected | Term Expires | Notes |
|---------|-------|---------------|--------------|-------|
| **Ruben Gallego** | Democrat | 2024 | January 2031 | Won 2024 special/regular election replacing Kyrsten Sinema. Former Marine, Phoenix-based. First Latino U.S. Senator from Arizona. |
| **Mark Kelly** | Democrat | 2020 (special) | January 2029 | Former astronaut, Navy Captain. Won 2020 special election, re-elected 2022. Gun safety advocate (wife Gabby Giffords survived shooting). Strong military credentials relevant to Fort Huachuca area. |

**Strategic Note:** Both U.S. Senators are Democrats. Mark Kelly in particular has strong appeal in military communities due to his Navy/NASA background. His office could be a potential ally for Fort Huachuca-related issues. Gallego, as a Marine veteran, also has military credibility.

---

## 3. COCHISE COUNTY GOVERNMENT

**County Seat:** Bisbee, AZ
**Population:** ~125,000 (2020 Census: 126,442)
**Character:** Largest county in LD-19 by population. Mix of military (Fort Huachuca), ranching, agriculture (wine), tourism (Tombstone), and border communities. Republican-leaning but competitive in some areas.

### Board of Supervisors (3 Districts)

| District | Supervisor | Party | Term Expires | Area Covered |
|----------|-----------|-------|--------------|--------------|
| 1 | Tom Crosby | R | [VERIFY] | Sierra Vista, Fort Huachuca area |
| 2 | **Kathleen Gomez** | **R** | 2029 (est.) | Bisbee, Douglas, southeastern county — **NEW: replaced Ann English (D) who did not seek re-election** |
| 3 | **Frank Antenori** | **R** | 2029 (est.) | Willcox, Benson, northern county — **NEW: replaced Peggy Judd (R); former state legislator** |

**VERIFIED 2025:** The board is now **ALL REPUBLICAN**. Ann English (D-District 2) — the lone Democratic voice — did not seek re-election. Frank Antenori, a former state legislator and hardline conservative, replaced Peggy Judd in District 3.

**KEY POLITICAL NOTE:** Cochise County Board of Supervisors gained national attention in **2022** when it initially refused to certify election results (the board was then 2R-1D). A court order forced certification. This controversy centered on Judd and Crosby. The loss of Ann English means there is **no natural Democratic ally remaining in Cochise County governance**.

## 4. GRAHAM COUNTY GOVERNMENT

**County Seat:** Safford, AZ
**Population:** ~40,100 (2020 Census: 38,837)
**Character:** Agricultural (cotton 54x national average), mining (Freeport-McMoRan), prisons (multiple state facilities), Eastern Arizona College. Solidly Republican. Home to a significant LDS (Mormon) community which influences politics.
**GDP:** $1.7 billion (ranks 15th of 15 AZ counties in per capita income)

### Board of Supervisors (3 Districts)

| District | Supervisor | Party | Term Expires | Area Covered |
|----------|-----------|-------|--------------|--------------|
| 1 | **Paul David** | **D** | [VERIFY] | Safford area — **KEY: Democrat winning in deep-red territory** |
| 2 | [VERIFY] | R | [VERIFY] | Thatcher/Pima area |
| 3 | [VERIFY] | R | [VERIFY] | Rural/outlying |

**VERIFIED (PARTIAL):** Paul David (D-District 1) is a confirmed **Democrat** serving on the Graham County Board in deeply Republican territory. His success is a proof-of-concept that Democrats can win local races here with the right candidate. The LDS community is a major political force, but David demonstrates it's not monolithic.

> [VERIFY] Remaining Graham County supervisors. Drew John (District 3) believed to be serving but needs confirmation.

## 5. GREENLEE COUNTY GOVERNMENT

**County Seat:** Clifton, AZ
**Population:** ~9,500 (2020 Census: 9,563)
**Character:** Arizona's least populous county. Economy is 90% mining (Freeport-McMoRan Morenci Mine, world's largest copper mine). Historically Democratic (voted D from statehood 1912 through 1996 when the mining union was broken). Now trending Republican.
**GDP:** Dominated by mining extraction.
**Poverty Rate:** 17.7% (47% above national average)

### Board of Supervisors (3 Districts)

| District | Supervisor | Party | Term Expires | Area Covered |
|----------|-----------|-------|--------------|--------------|
| 1 | **David Gomez** | **D** | [VERIFY] | **BOS CHAIRMAN** — 5th term, longest-serving. Won recount in 2024. |
| 2 | **Ron Campbell** | **I** | [VERIFY] | **Independent** — NOT Republican |
| 3 | **William Wearne** | **I** | [VERIFY] | **Independent** — NOT Republican |

**VERIFIED 2025:** Greenlee County BOS is **1 Democrat + 2 Independents + 0 Republicans**. This is one of the most remarkable political facts in LD-19. David Gomez (D) has served 5 terms and chairs the board. There are **NO Republicans on the Greenlee County Board of Supervisors** despite the county voting Republican in state/federal races. Richard Lunt is no longer serving.

**POLITICAL GOLDMINE:** This board composition proves Republican dominance in Greenlee County is shallow — it only applies to state/federal races where the party brand matters. At the local level, personal relationships and community service trump party affiliation.

### County Officials

| Position | Name | Party | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|-------|
| **County Manager/Administrator** | [VERIFY] | N/A | |
| **Sheriff** | **Eric Ellison** | **I** | **VERIFIED 2025**: First Independent sheriff in Arizona history. Defeated both R and D candidates in 2024. Replaced Tim Sumner. |
| **County Attorney** | [VERIFY] | | |
| **Recorder** | [VERIFY] | | |
| **Treasurer** | [VERIFY] | | |
| **Assessor** | [VERIFY] | | |

**KEY POLITICAL NOTE:** Greenlee County's political story is MORE NUANCED than a simple D-to-R shift. While the county votes Republican in state/federal races (driven by the 1983 Phelps Dodge strike aftermath and cultural realignment), **local governance tells a different story**: the BOS is 1D+2I+0R, and the sheriff is Independent. The Democratic heritage from 1912-1996 is not dead — it persists in local races where candidates are known personally. This is the strongest evidence in LD-19 that Republican dominance can be challenged by the right candidate.

## 6. PIMA COUNTY GOVERNMENT (LD-19 Overlap)

**County Seat:** Tucson, AZ
**Total Population:** ~1,043,000 (2020 Census: 1,043,433)
**Character:** Large urban county. **Only the southeastern portion overlaps LD-19** -- specifically the Vail and Corona de Tucson communities, and potentially parts of Green Valley (though Green Valley straddles the Pima/Santa Cruz county line).
**Political Lean:** Pima County overall is **Democratic-leaning** (unlike the rest of LD-19). However, the Vail/Corona de Tucson area that falls in LD-19 trends more conservative/independent.

### Board of Supervisors (5 Districts)

| District | Supervisor | Party | Overlap with LD-19? | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|----------------------|-------|
| 1 | Rex Scott | D | **Possible** | [VERIFY] Northeastern Tucson area |

| 4 | Steve Christy | R | **YES - Primary overlap** | Southeastern Pima County, Vail, Green Valley area |
| 5 | Adelita Grijalva | D | **No** | South Tucson/southwestern |

> [VERIFY] **District 4 (Steve Christy, R)** is the most likely Pima County supervisor district overlapping with LD-19. Christy has been the lone Republican on the Pima County Board of Supervisors. His district covers the more conservative southeastern portion of the county including Vail.
>
> [VERIFY] After 2024 elections, confirm all names are current. Matt Heinz won a seat in a 2022 special election. Board composition may have changed.

**Pima County Administrator:** Jan Lesher [VERIFY]
**Pima County Sheriff:** Chris Nanos (D) [VERIFY]
**Pima County Attorney:** Laura Conover (D) [VERIFY - she faced recall efforts]
**Pima County Recorder:** Gabriella Cazares-Kelly (D) [VERIFY]

**Strategic Note:** The Pima County portions of LD-19 are the most likely areas for Democratic votes, particularly in the Green Valley retirement community (though Green Valley itself is politically mixed -- retirees can be conservative on taxes but moderate/liberal on healthcare and Social Security).

## 7. SANTA CRUZ COUNTY GOVERNMENT (LD-19 Overlap)

**County Seat:** Nogales, AZ
**Total Population:** ~47,700 (2020 Census: 47,669)
**Character:** Border county. Only the **eastern portion** overlaps LD-19 -- specifically the Patagonia and Sonoita/Elgin areas. Nogales (the county seat and population center) is NOT in LD-19.
**Political Lean:** **Democratic-leaning** overall (heavily Hispanic, border community). However, the LD-19 portion (Patagonia/Sonoita) is more of a mix -- ranchers, retirees, artists.

### Board of Supervisors (3 Districts)

| District | Supervisor | Party | Overlap with LD-19? | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|----------------------|-------|
| 1 | **Luis Carlos Davis** | **D** | **No** (Nogales area) | **NEW (2025)** — replaced previous D1 supervisor |
| 2 | **Rudy Molera** | **D** | **Possible** | **5th term** — longest-serving, institutional knowledge |
| 3 | **John Fanning** | **D** | **YES - Primary overlap** | **NEW (2025)** — covers Patagonia/Sonoita area |

**VERIFIED 2025:** The board is **ALL DEMOCRAT**. Bruce Bracker is no longer serving (replaced by John Fanning in D3). Manuel Ruiz is no longer serving (replaced by Luis Carlos Davis in D1). Rudy Molera continues in his 5th term.

**KEY CAMPAIGN NOTE:** John Fanning (D-D3) covers the LD-19 overlap area (Patagonia/Sonoita/Elgin) and is a **natural ally** for any Democratic LD-19 candidate. Rudy Molera's 5-term institutional knowledge is invaluable.
