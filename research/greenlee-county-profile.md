### County-Wide Demographics (2020 Census / ACS Estimates)

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| **Total Population** | 9,563 | 2020 Census (verified) |
| **Median Age** | ~35 | Younger than AZ average due to working-age miners |
| **Racial/Ethnic Composition** | | |
| — White (non-Hispanic) | ~42-45% | |
| — Hispanic/Latino | ~50-55% | Historic mining workforce |
| — Native American | ~2-3% | |
| — Other | ~2-3% | |
| **Median Household Income** | **$75,239** (+/- $5,163) | ACS 2023 5-year — MUCH higher than expected |
| **Per Capita Income** | **$32,028** (+/- $2,994) | ACS 2023 |
| **Poverty Rate** | **10.8%** (+/- 3.3%) | ACS 2023 — ~1,016 persons; LOWER than previously cited 17.7% |
| **Unemployment** | Low when mine is operating | Mine cycles drive everything |
| **Veterans** | ~8-10% of adult population | |
| **Educational Attainment** | | |
| — High school diploma+ | ~80% | |
| — Bachelor's degree+ | ~12-15% | Well below AZ avg (~30%) |

### County GDP

The claim that **90% of GDP comes from mining** is broadly accurate. Greenlee County's economy is among the most concentrated single-industry economies in the United States. The Morenci mine complex is overwhelmingly the dominant economic engine. County GDP is heavily skewed by the mine's output. The BEA county GDP data would show mining/extraction as the vast majority of economic output. [VERIFY exact percentage with BEA data]

Agriculture (Duncan area) and government (county/schools) make up most of the remainder.

#### History

Clifton is one of Arizona's oldest continuously inhabited communities. It was founded as a copper mining camp in the 1870s. The town grew around the confluence of the San Francisco River and Chase Creek. At its peak in the early 20th century, Clifton was a vibrant multicultural community with distinct ethnic neighborhoods — Mexican, Italian, and Anglo sections of town.

The historic Chase Creek Street was once lined with saloons, shops, and the commerce of a booming mining district. The Clifton Jail — carved directly into a cliff face — remains one of Arizona's most unusual historical landmarks.

Clifton has experienced significant population fluctuations tied entirely to the fortunes of the mine. When copper is up, Clifton grows. When copper crashes, people leave.

#### Key Features

- **Chase Creek Historic District** — The heart of old Clifton, with 19th-century stone and brick buildings
- **Clifton Cliff Jail** — Arizona historical landmark, a jail literally carved into the rock cliff
- **Hot Springs** — Natural hot springs along the San Francisco River
- **Greenlee County Courthouse** — The center of county governance
- **San Francisco River** — Runs through town; flooding has been a recurring problem

#### Governance

- **Form of Government:** Mayor-Council
- **Mayor:** [VERIFY current name — as of my training, this would need confirmation]
- **Town Council:** [VERIFY current members]
- **Town Manager:** [VERIFY]

### MORENCI

**The Company Town — Freeport-McMoRan's Private Kingdom**

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Status** | Unincorporated CDP (Census Designated Place) |
| **Population (2020 Census)** | **2,028** (verified) |
| **Population (2010 Census)** | 1,489 |
| **Elevation** | ~4,700 ft |
| **Key Fact** | NOT a municipality — it is an unincorporated company town |

**This is one of the most important political facts about Greenlee County: Morenci has NO elected local government.** The town is effectively controlled by Freeport-McMoRan. The company owns the housing, operates the community facilities, and makes all land-use decisions. There is no mayor, no town council, no democratic local governance. Residents of Morenci vote in county and state elections but have no municipal government to petition.

#### Demographics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Median Age** | ~30-35 [VERIFY] — working-age population |
| **Hispanic/Latino** | ~55-65% |
| **White (non-Hispanic)** | ~30-35% |
| **Median Household Income** | ~$65,000-$80,000 [VERIFY] — mine wages are good |
| **Poverty Rate** | Lower than Clifton — employed mine workers |
| **Educational Attainment** | Trade/vocational emphasis |

#### The "New" Morenci

The original town of Morenci was demolished — literally scraped off the earth — by Phelps Dodge in the 1960s-1970s to expand the open-pit mine. The current "Morenci" is a planned company town built by Phelps Dodge (now Freeport-McMoRan) on a ridge above the pit. The old town, with its historic buildings, neighborhoods, churches, and community fabric, was destroyed for copper ore.

**Campaign angle:** The company literally destroyed the town to get at the copper underneath it. The residents were relocated to company-built housing. This is a powerful metaphor for corporate priorities over community.

#### Company Housing System

- Freeport-McMoRan owns virtually all housing in Morenci
- Housing is provided to employees as part of their compensation package (subsidized rent, significantly below market)
- Non-employees generally cannot live in Morenci
- When an employee leaves or is fired, they must vacate the housing
- This creates an extraordinary level of company control over residents' lives — lose your job, lose your home simultaneously
- Housing quality varies; the company has invested in upgrades over the years
- Morenci has a company-operated community center, pool, and recreational facilities

**Campaign angle:** This housing arrangement creates a captive community. Workers who might want to organize, protest, or even vote against company interests face the implicit threat of losing both their job AND their home. This chilling effect on democratic participation is a legitimate campaign issue.

### DUNCAN

**The Farming Town — The Gila Valley's Quiet Corner**

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Status** | Incorporated town |
| **Population (2020 Census)** | **689** (verified) |
| **Population (2010 Census)** | 696 |
| **Elevation** | ~3,640 ft |
| **Location** | Gila River valley, near NM border |
| **Character** | Small farming/ranching community |

#### Demographics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Hispanic/Latino** | ~50-60% |
| **White (non-Hispanic)** | ~35-40% |
| **Median Household Income** | ~$30,000-$38,000 [VERIFY] — significantly lower |
| **Poverty Rate** | ~25-30% [VERIFY] — highest in county |
| **Median Age** | Older than Clifton/Morenci |

#### Economy

Duncan's economy is fundamentally different from the mining communities. It is an agricultural town in the upper Gila Valley:

- Cattle ranching (primary)
- Hay, alfalfa, cotton (irrigated agriculture along the Gila River)
- Small-scale farming
- Some residents commute to the mine
- Government (school district, town government) is a significant employer proportionally

Duncan is geographically and economically isolated — it's the last Arizona town before New Mexico on US Route 70. The nearest significant services are in Safford (~30 miles west) or Lordsburg, NM (~45 miles east).

**Campaign angle:** Duncan represents the forgotten rural Arizona. No hospital access, limited services, aging infrastructure, water rights concerns. These are bread-and-butter Democratic issues if framed correctly.

## ECONOMICS & EMPLOYMENT

### The Morenci Mine — North America's Copper Colossus

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Operator** | Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (FCX) |
| **Historical Operators** | Detroit Copper Co. → Phelps Dodge → Freeport-McMoRan (2007 merger) |
| **Type** | Open-pit copper mine |
| **Ranking** | One of the largest copper mines in North America; among the top producing copper mines globally |
| **Ownership** | Freeport-McMoRan **72%**; Sumitomo Group entities **28%** (verified via FCX 10-K) |
| **Mine Life** | Operations began 1872; projected to continue for decades |

#### Production

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Annual Copper Output** | **~700 million lbs** (2024, verified via FCX annual report) |
| **Processing Capacity** | Two concentrators (132,000 metric tons/day), four SX plants, three EW tankhouses (~900M lbs/yr capacity) |
| **Mining Fleet** | 141 haul trucks (235-metric ton), 13 shovels, moving ~785,000 metric tons/day |
| **Mine Life** | Expected to continue until **2041** |
| **Method** | Open-pit mining + SX-EW (solvent extraction-electrowinning) + concentrator |
| **Pit Dimensions** | Approximately 1.5 miles wide × 1.3 miles across × 1,800+ feet deep |
| **Scale** | One of the world's largest man-made excavations |

The Morenci mine is massive on a scale that is difficult to comprehend. The open pit is visible from space. Entire mountains have been converted into tailings piles. The operation runs 24/7/365.

#### Employment

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Direct Employees** | **~1,706** (current, per Mining Technology; peaked at ~4,000 in 2003-2008, was ~3,300 in 2017, ~2,550 in 2011) |
| **Contractors** | Additional contractors at peak periods |
| **FCX Company-Wide** | 28,500 total employees (2024, up 4.78% from 27,200 in 2023) |
| **Average Miner Salary** | ~$60,000-$90,000+ depending on role and experience |
| **Benefits** | Health insurance, housing (Morenci), retirement plans |

This means the mine employs a workforce potentially equal to or exceeding the entire county population. Many workers commute from Safford, Thatcher, and other Graham County communities. This is critical — the mine's employment impact extends well beyond Greenlee County borders into LD-19's Graham County communities.

#### Economic Impact on Greenlee County

- **Property Tax:** Freeport-McMoRan is by far the largest property taxpayer in Greenlee County. The mine's assessed valuation supports the county government, school districts, and special districts.
- **Sales Tax:** Equipment, supplies, fuel purchases generate significant revenue.
- **Direct Payroll:** Hundreds of millions annually pumped into the regional economy.
- **Indirect Economy:** Every dollar of mine payroll generates additional economic activity in housing, retail, food, services.

**The dependency problem:** If the mine significantly curtails operations (as it has historically during copper price crashes), Greenlee County has virtually no economic fallback. The county's entire fiscal structure — school funding, road maintenance, emergency services — depends on mine-related revenue.

#### The $6.8M Environmental Settlement [VERIFY DETAILS]

Freeport-McMoRan (and previously Phelps Dodge) has faced multiple environmental enforcement actions related to the Morenci operation:

- **Air Quality:** Sulfur dioxide emissions from smelting operations (the Morenci smelter operated for decades; it was eventually closed). Dust from the open pit and tailings.
- **Water Contamination:** The San Francisco River and Chase Creek have been impacted by acid mine drainage, heavy metals, and processing chemicals. There have been Superfund-related designations in the area.
- **EPA Actions:** Multiple enforcement actions over the decades. A settlement in the range of $6.8M [VERIFY specific settlement — there have been multiple enforcement actions and settlements, and this figure may refer to a specific one] addressed violations related to the Clean Water Act and/or Clean Air Act.
- **Ongoing Issues:** Tailings dam management, water treatment, dust suppression, and groundwater monitoring are ongoing concerns.

**Campaign angle:** The environmental settlement amount, whatever the exact figure, is a pittance compared to Freeport-McMoRan's annual revenue (~$22+ billion) and profits. This frames as a company that treats environmental fines as a cost of doing business rather than a genuine commitment to community health.

#### Safety Record

Mining is inherently dangerous. The Morenci mine has had fatalities and serious injuries over its 150+ year history:

- Modern safety standards have improved conditions dramatically since the early days
- Freeport-McMoRan publishes safety metrics in its annual sustainability reports
- MSHA (Mine Safety and Health Administration) conducts regular inspections
- The mine has had fatalities in recent decades [VERIFY specific incidents and dates]
- Common hazards: heavy equipment, blasting, pit wall stability, heat exposure, dust inhalation
- The company has invested in safety programs but the fundamental risks of open-pit mining remain

[VERIFY: Pull MSHA inspection data and fatality records for specific incidents]

#### Other Employers Besides Freeport

| Employer | Sector | Approximate Size |
|----------|--------|-----------------|
| Greenlee County Government | Government | ~100-150 employees |
| Clifton Unified School District | Education | ~100-150 |
| Morenci Unified School District | Education | ~100-150 |
| Duncan Unified School District | Education | ~30-50 |
| Town of Clifton | Government | ~20-40 |
| Small retail/service businesses | Various | Scattered |
| Ranching operations | Agriculture | Family-scale |

The brutal reality: outside of Freeport-McMoRan and government/education, there are essentially no significant employers in Greenlee County.

## POLITICAL HISTORY (CRITICAL)

### The Democratic Streak: 1912-1996

Greenlee County voted Democratic in every presidential election from Arizona statehood (1912) through 1996. This is an **84-year streak** — one of the longest continuous Democratic voting records in the rural Mountain West.

#### Why Democrats Won for 84 Years

The answer is **copper unions**.

From the early 1900s through the mid-1980s, Greenlee County's political identity was defined by organized labor in the copper mines:

1. **The International Union of Mine, Mill, and Smelter Workers (Mine Mill)** organized the Clifton-Morenci mining district in the early 20th century. Mine Mill was one of the most radical unions in America — it was expelled from the CIO in 1950 for alleged Communist influence.

2. **Mine Mill merged into the United Steelworkers of America (USWA)** in 1967. The Steelworkers continued to represent Morenci miners.

3. **The New Deal Coalition:** Mining families — overwhelmingly Mexican-American and working-class white — were natural New Deal Democrats. The union provided:
   - Political education and mobilization
   - A collective identity that transcended ethnic lines (though tensions existed)
   - Get-out-the-vote infrastructure
   - A direct pipeline between workers' economic interests and the Democratic Party

4. **The Mexican-American workforce:** The Clifton-Morenci district had a majority Mexican-American population from its earliest days. These workers faced discrimination (the "dual wage system" paid Mexican workers less than Anglo workers for identical work into the mid-20th century), which reinforced Democratic loyalty.

5. **1915 Clifton-Morenci Strike:** One of Arizona's defining labor actions. 5,000 miners struck for better wages and an end to the dual wage system. The Western Federation of Miners led the action. This established the district's militant labor identity.

6. **1946 Empire Zinc Strike:** While this occurred in New Mexico (Grant County), it deeply influenced the Clifton-Morenci mining community and was the basis for the blacklisted film "Salt of the Earth" (1954). The cross-border solidarity between Arizona and New Mexico copper miners reinforced union culture.

7. **Continuous labor actions:** Throughout the mid-20th century, pattern bargaining in the copper industry meant that Clifton-Morenci workers struck regularly (roughly every 3 years during contract negotiations). Each strike reinforced solidarity and Democratic political identity.

### The 1983 Phelps Dodge Strike — The Breaking Point

**This is one of the most consequential labor events in late 20th-century American history.** It should be studied by anyone running a working-class campaign in Arizona.

#### What Happened

**July 1, 1983:** The United Steelworkers of America and 12 other unions representing Morenci, Ajo, and Douglas copper mine workers went on strike against Phelps Dodge Corporation when the company demanded wage freezes and benefit concessions during a copper price downturn. The other major copper companies (Kennecott, ASARCO, Magma) had settled with the unions, but Phelps Dodge — led by CEO Richard Moolick and later George Munroe — refused to follow the industry pattern.

**August 1983:** Phelps Dodge began hiring permanent replacement workers (scabs). This was a radical escalation — it had been decades since a major American employer had used permanent replacements. (Ronald Reagan's firing of the PATCO air traffic controllers in 1981 had established the political climate for this tactic.)

**August 19-20, 1983:** Arizona Governor Bruce Babbitt (Democrat) deployed the National Guard and DPS (Department of Public Safety) to Morenci after violent confrontations between strikers, replacement workers, and security forces. Tear gas was used. The sight of a Democratic governor sending troops against striking miners was a traumatic betrayal for the labor movement.

**The Strike Continued:** For over a year, strikers held out. Families were split — some workers crossed picket lines while their neighbors and relatives continued striking. The community was torn apart along class, ethnic, and family lines.

**1984:** Phelps Dodge successfully petitioned for a decertification election. With replacement workers now eligible to vote and many strikers having left the area, the unions were voted out.

**1985-1986:** The strike officially ended in defeat. The unions were decertified. Phelps Dodge had broken the Steelworkers and 12 allied unions.

#### The Consequences

1. **Economic devastation:** Striking families lost everything. Many lost their homes (including company housing in Morenci). Families that had lived in the Clifton-Morenci area for generations were forced to leave.

2. **Community destruction:** The strike split families and neighborhoods. Lifelong friendships ended. The ethnic solidarity between Mexican-American and Anglo workers — always imperfect but real — was shattered. Families that had intermarried found themselves on opposite sides.

3. **Political realignment:** With the union destroyed, the institutional infrastructure of Democratic politics in Greenlee County collapsed. The union had been the Democratic Party's organizing apparatus. Without it, there was no ground game, no voter mobilization, no political education.

4. **The 1996 break:** Greenlee County voted for Clinton in 1996 — the last time it went Democratic in a presidential race. By 2000, the realignment was complete. The county has voted Republican since.

5. **National significance:** The Phelps Dodge strike is considered a landmark in the decline of American organized labor. It demonstrated that employers could use permanent replacements to break unions, a tactic that spread rapidly through American industry in the late 1980s and 1990s. Jonathan Rosenblum, Barbara Kingsolver (who wrote "Holding the Line" about the strike), and labor historians have documented it extensively.

#### The Strike's Racial Dimension

This is uncomfortable but essential: Phelps Dodge exploited racial tensions to break the strike. The replacement workers were disproportionately Anglo, while the striking workforce was majority Mexican-American. The company framed the strike as the actions of troublemakers and outsiders, playing on racial resentments. After the strike, the workforce composition shifted, and the mine's internal culture changed.

#### Key Books and Sources

- **"Holding the Line: Women in the Great Arizona Mine Strike of 1983"** by Barbara Kingsolver (1989) — Essential reading. Kingsolver (before she became a famous novelist) documented the strike from the perspective of the miners' wives and families. This is a primary source on the community impact.
- **"Copper Crucible: How the Arizona Miners' Strike of 1983 Recast Labor-Management Relations in America"** by Jonathan Rosenblum (1995) — The definitive academic history.
- **"Salt of the Earth"** (1954 film) — About the earlier Mine Mill era. Blacklisted during McCarthyism.

### Post-Strike Voting Patterns

| Year | Greenlee County Presidential Vote | Winner |
|------|----------------------------------|--------|
| 1992 | Clinton (D) | Democratic — union memories still alive |
| 1996 | Clinton (D) | Democratic — last Dem win |
| 2000 | Bush (R) | Republican — the switch |
| 2004 | Bush (R) | Republican |
| 2008 | McCain (R) | Republican (also AZ native son) |
| 2012 | Romney (R) | Republican |
| 2016 | Trump (R) | Republican — strong |
| 2020 | Trump (R) | Republican — strong |
| 2024 | Trump (R) [VERIFY] | Republican — assumed strong |

[VERIFY: Pull exact margins for each year from AZ Secretary of State]

The pattern is clear: once the union infrastructure was destroyed, Democratic voting in Greenlee County collapsed within one generation. The 2000 election — the first with essentially no union organizational presence — was the tipping point.

### Current State of Labor Organizing

- **No union at Morenci mine.** The mine has been non-union since 1984-1986 decertification.
- Freeport-McMoRan's compensation and benefits are competitive enough to reduce organizing pressure — this is deliberate. The company learned from the strike that it's cheaper to pay well than to fight unions.
- There have been no significant organizing drives at Morenci since decertification [VERIFY for any recent activity].
- The broader labor movement in Arizona has focused on other sectors (service, healthcare, education) rather than attempting to re-organize the copper mines.
- The cultural memory of the 1983 strike defeat acts as a deterrent to organizing — workers remember (or have been told) what happened to strikers.

### 2024 Election Results [VERIFY]

Greenlee County almost certainly voted strongly Republican in 2024. The margin and specific numbers need verification from the Greenlee County Recorder or Arizona Secretary of State.

## CURRENT GOVERNANCE

### Greenlee County Board of Supervisors

The county has 3 supervisory districts:

| District | Name | Party | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|-------|
| District 1 | **David Gomez** | **Democrat** | Chairman; **5th term** — won recount in 2024. Covers Clifton area |
| District 2 | **Ron S. Campbell** | **Independent** | Vice Chairman; appointed April 2011, ran unopposed 2024 |
| District 3 | **William Wearne** | **Independent** | Won 2024 with 548 votes as Independent |

**CRITICAL FINDING:** Greenlee County BOS is **1 Democrat + 2 Independents + 0 Republicans**. This is the opposite of what was assumed. Greenlee County reportedly has more elected Independent candidates than the rest of Arizona's counties combined.

### Other County Officials

| Position | Name | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|
| **County Sheriff** | **Eric Ellison** | **Independent** — First Independent county sheriff in Arizona history. Defeated R (Dale Sloan) and D (Daniel Medina) in Nov 2024. Took office Jan 1, 2025. |
| County Attorney | [VERIFY] | |
| County Recorder | Contact: (928) 865-2632 | |

### Town of Clifton

| Position | Name | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|
| **Mayor** | **Laura Dorrell** | Since 2023 |
| Town Council | [VERIFY members] | |
| Town Manager | [VERIFY] | |

### Town of Duncan

| Position | Name | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|
| Mayor | [VERIFY] | |
| Town Council | [VERIFY] | |

### Morenci — NO Municipal Government

Morenci is an **unincorporated community**. It has:
- No mayor
- No town council
- No municipal charter
- No local ordinances
- No local elections (beyond county/state/federal)

Freeport-McMoRan effectively governs the community through:
- Ownership of all residential property (housing assignments)
- Operation of community facilities (recreation center, pool, etc.)
- Control of commercial leases (the company store model)
- Provision of water and utilities
- Road maintenance and infrastructure decisions

County services (sheriff, road maintenance on county roads) apply, but the day-to-day governance of Morenci is corporate, not democratic.

**Campaign angle:** Nearly 2,000 Arizonans live in a community with zero democratic local governance. They are governed by their employer. This is a legitimate issue of democratic representation.

### School Districts

| District | Communities Served | Notes |
|----------|-------------------|-------|
| Morenci Unified School District #18 | Morenci, parts of Clifton | Freeport-McMoRan is a major funder |
| Clifton Unified School District | Clifton | |
| Duncan Unified School District #2 | Duncan, surrounding area | Small rural district |

The school districts are among the few democratic institutions in Morenci — school board members are elected by the community, giving Morenci residents one of their only venues for democratic participation in local governance.

### Tribal Governance

- **San Carlos Apache Reservation** borders Greenlee County to the north/northwest
- There is minimal direct overlap between the reservation and Greenlee County communities
- However, some Apache community members may work at the mine or have economic ties to the area
- The Apache Tribe has independent sovereignty and governance
- Water rights along the Gila River system involve tribal interests

---

## KEY ISSUES

### 1. Mining Company Dominance Over Local Politics and Economy

**The Issue:** Greenlee County has a single-employer economy that would make a company town from the Gilded Age blush. Freeport-McMoRan's influence extends into every aspect of life:

- **Economic:** The mine is essentially the only significant private employer
- **Political:** The company's property tax payments fund the county; officials are reluctant to challenge their fiscal lifeline
- **Social:** In Morenci, the company controls housing and community infrastructure
- **Cultural:** The defeat of the union in 1983 removed the only institutional counterweight to corporate power

**What this means for campaign:** This is the central tension of Greenlee County politics. A campaign cannot be perceived as "anti-mine" (mining is how people feed their families), but CAN advocate for workers' rights, environmental accountability, and diversified economic development.

### 2. NO Hospital in Greenlee County (CONFIRMED)

**The Issue:** Greenlee County has **NO hospital** within its borders. CONFIRMED. Medical emergencies require transport to:

- **Mt. Graham Regional Medical Center** in Safford (~50 miles from Morenci) — the closest full-service hospital, serving both Graham and Greenlee Counties
- **Tucson hospitals** for trauma/specialty care (~3+ hours)

Healthcare access in Greenlee County consists of:
- **Gila Health Resources** — operates a **24-hour Urgent Care Department** in Morenci (401 Burro Alley, Morenci, AZ 85540; 928-865-7501). Services: family medicine, occupational medicine, physical therapy, lab, radiology, ultrasound. Staffed by licensed physicians, PAs, RNs.
- **Morenci Healthcare Center, Inc.** — co-located at same facility, separate entrance
- **Copper Mountain Clinic** (associated with Mt. Graham Regional) — family medicine
- **Greenlee County Health Department** (253 Fifth St, Clifton) — immunizations, communicable disease, TB control, family planning
- **Gila Health Resources ambulance service** — emergency ground and air transport throughout Greenlee County

**Campaign angle:** A county that generates hundreds of millions in mineral wealth has no hospital. Where does the wealth go? This is a powerful framing for healthcare access messaging.

### 3. Environmental Impacts

#### Water Contamination
- The San Francisco River and its tributaries have been impacted by over a century of mining
- Acid mine drainage introduces heavy metals (copper, zinc, cadmium, lead) into waterways
- Chase Creek in Clifton has been particularly affected
- Groundwater contamination concerns near tailings facilities

#### Air Quality
- Dust from the open pit and tailings piles
- The Morenci smelter (now closed) historically produced sulfur dioxide emissions
- Blasting produces dust and particulates
- Diesel exhaust from the massive haul trucks

#### Tailings
- The Morenci mine has enormous tailings piles — mountains of processed waste rock
- Tailings dam failure is a catastrophic risk (see failures globally: Brumadinho, Brazil, 2019)
- Long-term management and remediation costs are a concern
- Who pays for cleanup when the mine eventually closes?

[VERIFY: Check EPA Superfund/CERCLA status for Clifton-Morenci area. There may be listed sites.]

### 4. Housing

- **Morenci:** Company-controlled housing creates dependency
- **Clifton:** Housing stock is aging; some damage from flooding events
- **Duncan:** Limited housing; rural aging stock
- **Affordability:** Mine wages make housing affordable for mine workers, but non-mine workers face challenges
- **The company housing trap:** Workers in Morenci cannot build equity. They don't own their homes. They have no property to pass to children. This is wealth extraction from the working class.

### 5. Water Rights — The Gila River System

- The Gila River runs through the Duncan area; the San Francisco River runs through Clifton
- Mining operations consume enormous quantities of water
- Agricultural water users in the Duncan area compete with mining for Gila River water
- The broader Gila River adjudication (one of Arizona's largest water rights proceedings) involves Greenlee County
- Climate change and drought threaten both surface water and groundwater
- Arizona's "use it or lose it" water law creates perverse incentives

### 6. What Happens If Copper Prices Crash?

This is the existential question for Greenlee County. Historical precedent:

- **1982-1983:** Copper price crash triggered the confrontation that led to the Phelps Dodge strike
- **2008-2009:** Global financial crisis reduced copper prices; Morenci reduced production and laid off workers
- **2015-2016:** Another copper downturn; production adjustments

If copper prices crash significantly and sustain low levels:
1. Freeport-McMoRan curtails production (reduces shifts, idles processing)
2. Layoffs ripple through the workforce
3. Contract workers are cut first
4. Property tax revenue to the county drops
5. School enrollment drops as families leave
6. Businesses in Clifton lose customers
7. The entire county fiscal structure is threatened

**The green energy transition provides an interesting hedge:** Copper is essential for electric vehicles, renewable energy infrastructure, and electrical grid modernization. Long-term copper demand is projected to increase significantly. This could be a positive framing for the mine's future — but it doesn't address the structural dependency problem.

### 7. Worker Safety

- Open-pit mining involves blasting, heavy equipment, extreme heat, dust exposure
- MSHA regulates mine safety; violations and citations are public record
- Fatalities have occurred at Morenci [VERIFY specific recent incidents]
- Without a union, workers have less collective power to advocate for safety improvements
- Workers may fear reporting safety concerns due to the company housing dynamic (lose job = lose home)

## CAMPAIGN STRATEGY IMPLICATIONS

### Why This History Matters for Ramirez for House

Greenlee County is small — ~9,500 people — so its raw vote total won't decide the LD-19 race. But its political history is **priceless campaign material** for three reasons:

#### 1. The Narrative

The story of Greenlee County is the story of the American working class in microcosm:

> "For 84 years, the copper miners of Clifton and Morenci voted for the party that stood with working people. They voted Democratic because their union told them the truth: that the company would take everything if workers didn't stand together. Then the company broke the union, and within one generation, those same working families started voting for the party of the company. Not because their interests changed — because the institution that connected their interests to their vote was destroyed."

This narrative works not just in Greenlee County but **across LD-19** — in Sierra Vista (where military families face similar institutional dependencies), in Green Valley (where retirees remember the old labor movement), and in the Gila Valley (where agricultural workers understand corporate power).

#### 2. The Authenticity Test

A candidate who understands the 1983 Phelps Dodge strike, who can speak to what it did to families, who can name the book ("Holding the Line") and the history — that candidate earns immediate credibility with the older Mexican-American and working-class voters who lived through it or whose parents did.

**Specific moves:**
- Hold a campaign event on Chase Creek in Clifton. Walk the historic district.
- Reference the strike in speeches — not as ancient history but as the moment when working people lost their voice.
- Meet with surviving strikers and their families. Record their stories.
- Frame the company housing issue in Morenci as a democratic rights issue, not an anti-business issue.

#### 3. The Policy Platform Connection

Greenlee County's issues map perfectly onto a working-class Democratic platform:

| Greenlee Issue | Policy Position |
|----------------|----------------|
| No hospital | Healthcare access / rural health investment |
| Company town housing | Workers' rights / housing equity |
| Environmental contamination | Environmental accountability WITHOUT being anti-mining |
| Single-employer dependency | Economic diversification / broadband / small business support |
| No union representation | Workers' right to organize (carefully framed) |
| Water rights | Sustainable water management |
| School funding dependent on mine | State education funding reform |

#### 4. Vote Potential

Greenlee County won't provide thousands of votes, but in a close race, every vote matters:

- Total eligible voters: ~6,000-7,000 [VERIFY]
- Current likely split: ~65-70% R, ~25-30% D [VERIFY]
- **Persuadable universe:** Older Hispanic voters who remember the union days; mine workers worried about safety and housing; young families concerned about healthcare and schools
- **Realistic goal:** Narrow the Republican margin by 5-10 points through targeted outreach. In a county this small, that might mean flipping 200-400 votes — which could matter in a district-wide race.

### Key Contacts to Develop [ALL NEED VERIFICATION]

| Category | Target | Why |
|----------|--------|-----|
| **Strike Veterans** | Surviving 1983 strikers and families | Living memory, moral authority |
| **Copper Era Editor** | [VERIFY name] | Local media gatekeeper |
| **Catholic Parishes** | Priests/deacons in Clifton & Morenci | Community moral leadership |
| **School Leaders** | Superintendents of all 3 districts | Connected to every family |
| **County Supervisors** | All 3 — even if Republican | Respectful engagement matters |
| **Clifton Mayor** | [VERIFY] | Town's political leader |
| **Mine Workers (quiet)** | Individual conversations, not public events | Company will retaliate against perceived organizers |

### Risks

1. **Being perceived as anti-mine:** Fatal. Frame as pro-worker, pro-community, pro-accountability — never anti-mining.
2. **Freeport-McMoRan opposition:** The company will support Republican candidates. Don't provoke them unnecessarily, but don't fear them either.
3. **Small vote yield for large effort:** Greenlee County requires significant travel time to reach from the rest of LD-19. Resource allocation must be realistic.
4. **Cultural distance:** If the candidate doesn't have mining community roots, authenticity must be established through genuine engagement, not performance.
