## 1. DISTRICT-WIDE VOTER REGISTRATION

### Current Registration (November 2024)

| Party | Percentage | Estimated Voters* |
|-------|-----------|-------------------|
| Republican | 43% | ~49,000 |
| Democrat | 24% | ~27,000 |
| Independent/Other | 33% | ~38,000 |
| **Total Active Registered** | 100% | **~114,000** |

*Estimated based on ~230,476 total population, ~50% registration rate typical for rural AZ districts*

**Registration Gap:** R+19 points

### Registration Trends Over Time

| Year | Republican | Democrat | Independent/Other | R-D Gap | Notes |
|------|-----------|----------|-------------------|---------|-------|
| 2024 | 43% | 24% | 33% | R+19 | Current district boundaries |
| 2022 | [DATA GAP] | [DATA GAP] | [DATA GAP] | [DATA GAP] | First election under new boundaries |
| 2020 | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | Old LD-19 was different district entirely |
| 2018 | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | Old LD-19 was different district entirely |

> **CRITICAL NOTE ON REDISTRICTING:** The current LD-19 was created after the 2020 Census redistricting cycle. The Arizona Independent Redistricting Commission approved the new legislative map on January 21, 2022. The new boundaries took effect January 9, 2023. **The old LD-19 (pre-2022) was a completely different district** — a heavily Democratic district in the Phoenix metro area represented by Mark Cardenas and Diego Espinoza. Any comparison to pre-2022 LD-19 data is MEANINGLESS for campaign planning. Only 2022 and 2024 results reflect the current district.

### AIRC Classification

### Presidential (Trump vs. Harris) — County-Level Results 2024

| County | Trump Votes | Trump % | Harris Votes | Harris % | Margin |
|--------|-------------|---------|--------------|----------|--------|
| **Cochise** | 35,936 | 60.8% | 22,296 | 37.7% | R+23.1 |
| **Graham** | — | ~73.4% | — | ~24.8% | R+48.6 |
| **Greenlee** | — | ~60.2% | — | ~38.1% | R+22.1 |
| **Pima** | 214,669 | ~43.5% | 292,450 | ~55.1% | D+11.6 |
| **Santa Cruz** | — | — | — | — | D+~8 [NEEDS VERIFICATION] |

**Cochise County notes:** 72.35% turnout, 82,242 registered voters, 59,501 ballots cast. Libertarian Oliver/ter Maat received 380 votes (0.64%). Source: Cochise County official cumulative report.

**Santa Cruz County notes:** Harris won Santa Cruz, but Trump made significant gains — roughly a 9+ point rightward shift from 2020 (Biden won by ~35.5 pts in 2020). This was Trump's second-largest county-level improvement in AZ. [Exact vote totals still DATA GAP — need county recorder PDF]

**Graham/Greenlee notes:** Percentages sourced from Grokipedia mirror of Wikipedia data. Exact vote totals require county recorder lookup. Graham had 73.99% turnout in 2024.

> **IMPORTANT:** The Pima and Santa Cruz numbers reflect ENTIRE county, not just the LD-19 portions. The LD-19 slices of Pima (Vail, Green Valley, Corona de Tucson) and Santa Cruz (Patagonia, Sonoita) are more conservative than their county averages. Precinct-level data is needed for accurate LD-19 presidential performance.

### U.S. Senate (Gallego vs. Lake) — County-Level Results 2024

| County | Gallego (D) Votes | Gallego % | Lake (R) Votes | Lake % | Margin |
|--------|-------------------|-----------|----------------|--------|--------|
| **Cochise** | 23,347 | 40.2% | 33,184 | 57.1% | R+16.9 |
| **Graham** | 4,235 | 28.3% | 10,385 | 69.3% | R+41.0 |
| **Greenlee** | 1,102 | 33.6% | 2,078 | 63.3% | R+29.7 |
| **Pima** | 298,751 | 59.1% | 193,021 | 38.2% | D+20.9 |
| **Santa Cruz** | 11,986 | 63.0% | 6,370 | 34.0% | D+29.0 |

Sources: Grokipedia (Wikipedia mirror), BallotWire. Green Party candidate Eduardo Quintana received 2-3% across all counties.

**KEY INSIGHT — Gallego massively outperformed Harris in every county:**

| County | Harris % | Gallego % | Gallego Overperformance |
|--------|----------|-----------|------------------------|
| Cochise | 37.7% | 40.2% | **+2.5 pts** |
| Graham | ~24.8% | 28.3% | **+3.5 pts** |
| Greenlee | ~38.1% | 33.6% | -4.5 pts [NEEDS VERIFICATION — may be data quality issue] |
| Pima | ~55.1% | 59.1% | **+4.0 pts** |
| Santa Cruz | — | 63.0% | significant |

> **STRATEGIC SIGNIFICANCE:** In Cochise County alone, Gallego received 23,347 votes vs. Harris's 22,296 — over 1,000 additional crossover votes in this single county. This proves ticket-splitting exists even in deep-red LD-19 territory. A Democratic House candidate with Gallego-like appeal (military veteran, pragmatic messaging) could tap this crossover pool.

### Notable Ballot Propositions

[DATA GAP — Arizona 2024 ballot propositions results by LD-19 precincts need county-level lookup. Key statewide propositions to check:
- **Prop 139** (Right to Abortion): Passed statewide 61.6-38.4% — performance in LD-19 would be extremely revealing for campaign strategy
- **Prop 140** (Open Primaries): Narrowly failed statewide — LD-19 performance would indicate appetite for reform
- **Prop 314** (Border Security): Passed overwhelmingly — LD-19 likely near 80%+ in favor]

## 3. 2022 ELECTION RESULTS IN LD-19 (First Election Under New Boundaries)

### State House (2 seats)

| Candidate | Party | Votes | Percentage | Result |
|-----------|-------|-------|------------|--------|
| **Gail Griffin** | R | 53,891 | 38.6% | **ELECTED** |
| **Lupe Diaz** | R | 49,561 | 35.5% | **ELECTED** |
| **Sanda Clark** | D | 36,242 | 25.9% | DEFEATED |
| **Total Votes Cast** | | **139,694** | | |

**Primary Results (Republican):**
| Candidate | Percentage |
|-----------|-----------|
| Gail Griffin | 55.0% |
| Lupe Diaz | 45.0% |

**Primary Results (Democratic):**
| Candidate | Percentage |
|-----------|-----------|
| Sanda Clark | 100.0% (unopposed) |

### State Senate (2022)

**David Gowan ran UNOPPOSED in both primary and general election.**

| Candidate | Party | Votes | Percentage | Result |
|-----------|-------|-------|------------|--------|
| David Gowan | R | 67,200 | 100.0% | **ELECTED** (unopposed) |

Primary: Gowan received 31,467 votes (unopposed).

> **STRATEGIC NOTE:** The fact that Gowan ran completely unopposed in 2022 is significant. No Democrat even filed. This means there was ZERO Democratic infrastructure tested in the Senate race that year.

### Governor (Hobbs vs. Lake) — County-Level Results 2022

| County | Hobbs (D) Votes | Hobbs % | Lake (R) Votes | Lake % | Margin |
|--------|-----------------|---------|----------------|--------|--------|
| **Cochise** | 19,137 | 41.1% | 27,481 | 58.9% | R+17.8 |
| **Graham** | 3,087 | 28.5% | 7,760 | 71.5% | R+43.0 |
| **Greenlee** | 920 | 37.6% | 1,526 | 62.4% | R+24.8 |
| **Pima** | 241,398 | 60.6% | 157,034 | 39.4% | D+21.2 |
| **Santa Cruz** | 8,724 | 66.6% | 4,371 | 33.4% | D+33.2 |

Source: NBC News, Grokipedia (Wikipedia mirror). Statewide: Hobbs 1,287,890 (50.33%) vs. Lake 1,270,774 (49.67%).

> **LAKE 2022 vs. LAKE 2024 COMPARISON:** Lake ran for Governor in 2022 and Senate in 2024, providing a direct comparison of her performance across cycles in these counties:
>
> | County | Lake 2022 (Gov) | Lake 2024 (Senate) | Change |
> |--------|-----------------|-------------------|--------|
> | Cochise | 58.9% | 57.1% | **-1.8 pts** |
> | Graham | 71.5% | 69.3% | **-2.2 pts** |
> | Greenlee | 62.4% | 63.3% | +0.9 pts |
> | Pima | 39.4% | 38.2% | **-1.2 pts** |
> | Santa Cruz | 33.4% | 34.0% | +0.6 pts |
>
> Lake generally lost ground in 2024, even as Trump carried the state. This underperformance relative to Trump created the ticket-splitting opportunity that Gallego exploited.

### Secretary of State, AG, Other Statewide

[DATA GAP — These races need county-level aggregation. Of particular interest:
- **AG (Mayes vs. Hamadeh):** Mayes won statewide as a Republican-turned-independent. Her performance in LD-19 could indicate moderate R crossover potential.
- **Secretary of State (Fontes vs. Finchem):** Finchem was from Oro Valley (near LD-19). His performance in his home territory vs. statewide is relevant.]

### Turnout (2022)

Cochise County: ~61% turnout (per Herald Review, compared to 72.35% in 2024).
Graham County: [DATA GAP]
Greenlee County: [DATA GAP]
Pima County: [DATA GAP for LD-19 precincts]
Santa Cruz County: [DATA GAP]

> **DROP-OFF PATTERN:** The ~11 percentage point turnout increase from 2022 (midterm) to 2024 (presidential) in Cochise County is significant. Understanding WHO these additional voters are (party, age, precinct) is critical for campaign planning.

## 4. 2020 ELECTION RESULTS

> **CRITICAL NOTE:** The 2020 election used the OLD district boundaries. The old LD-19 was a Democratic district in the Phoenix metro area. There is NO direct comparison to the current LD-19.

### What We Know About Current LD-19 Territory in 2020

The communities now in LD-19 were previously split among several different legislative districts (primarily the old LD-14 for Cochise County, old LD-1 for Graham/Greenlee, and parts of the old LD-2 for Pima County portions). To reconstruct 2020 performance in the current LD-19 footprint requires precinct-level aggregation.

**County-Level 2020 Presidential Results:**

| County | Biden (D) Votes | Biden % | Trump (R) Votes | Trump % | Margin |
|--------|-----------------|---------|-----------------|---------|--------|
| **Cochise** | 23,732 | 39.3% | 35,557 | 58.8% | R+19.5 |
| **Graham** | 4,034 | 26.9% | 10,749 | 71.7% | R+44.8 |
| **Greenlee** | 1,182 | 32.1% | 2,433 | 66.0% | R+33.9 |
| **Pima** | 304,981 | 58.6% | 207,758 | 39.9% | D+18.7 |
| **Santa Cruz** | 13,138 | 67.2% | 6,194 | 31.7% | D+35.5 |

Source: econdataus.com (aggregated from AZ SOS canvass data).

> **Key insight:** The Pima County and Santa Cruz County portions of LD-19 (Vail, Green Valley, Corona de Tucson, Patagonia) come from generally more moderate/Democratic-leaning territory at the county level, though these specific communities tend to be more conservative than their county averages.

### U.S. Senate 2020 (Kelly vs. McSally) — County-Level Results

| County | Kelly (D) Votes | Kelly % | McSally (R) Votes | McSally % | Margin |
|--------|-----------------|---------|-------------------|-----------|--------|
| **Cochise** | 24,843 | 41.4% | 35,214 | 58.6% | R+17.2 |
| **Graham** | 4,506 | 30.4% | 10,303 | 69.6% | R+39.2 |
| **Greenlee** | 1,403 | 38.7% | 2,225 | 61.3% | R+22.6 |
| **Pima** | 309,142 | 59.9% | 207,317 | 40.1% | D+19.8 |
| **Santa Cruz** | 13,689 | 70.7% | 5,685 | 29.3% | D+41.4 |

Source: econdataus.com (aggregated from AZ SOS canvass data). Kelly won statewide 51.2-48.8%.

**KEY INSIGHT — Kelly outperformed Biden in every county:**

| County | Biden % | Kelly % | Kelly Overperformance |
|--------|---------|---------|----------------------|
| Cochise | 39.3% | 41.4% | **+2.1 pts** |
| Graham | 26.9% | 30.4% | **+3.5 pts** |
| Greenlee | 32.1% | 38.7% | **+6.6 pts** |
| Pima | 58.6% | 59.9% | **+1.3 pts** |
| Santa Cruz | 67.2% | 70.7% | **+3.5 pts** |

> Kelly's military background (Navy pilot, astronaut) resonated with Fort Huachuca voters and the generally military-friendly population. His overperformance — especially the **+6.6 point advantage in Greenlee County** — proves that the right Democratic candidate can substantially outrun the party brand in LD-19. Compare this to Gallego's similar overperformance pattern in 2024.

### Old LD-19 House 2020 Results (for reference only — different district)

From Ballotpedia data:
- Democratic Primary: 52.9% / 47.1% (two D candidates)
- General: 41.6% / 36.5% / 21.9% (three candidates, Democrats won both seats)
- Republican Primary: One candidate, 100.0%

**This is the OLD LD-19. Not relevant to current boundaries.**

| **TOTAL** | | ~96 precincts | |

### Precinct Analysis Framework

[DATA GAP — Full precinct-level analysis requires downloading canvass reports from each county. This is the HIGHEST PRIORITY follow-up task.]

**Expected Democratic-leaning precincts (based on community demographics):**
1. **Green Valley** — Retirement community, historically moderate, strong Dem registration for a retirement area
2. **Patagonia** — Small arts community, progressive-leaning
3. **Fort Huachuca on-base precincts** — Military, but with more diverse population than surrounding area
4. **Parts of Corona de Tucson** — Tucson suburban spillover

**Expected closest-margin precincts:**
1. **Vail** — High-income suburban, rejected incorporation (anti-tax), but suburban trends nationally favor Democrats
2. **Green Valley** — Senior voters increasingly swing
3. **Sierra Vista proper** — The city itself is more moderate than surrounding rural areas
4. **Benson** — Small but could have competitive margins in some precincts

**Expected highest-Independent registration:**
1. **Vail** — Affluent suburban voters more likely to register Independent
2. **Green Valley** — Retirees from other states often register Independent
3. **Sierra Vista** — Military transplants often register Independent
4. **Patagonia/Sonoita** — Artistic/ranching community with libertarian streak

## 6. TREND ANALYSIS

### Is the District Trending More or Less Republican?

**Short answer:** Unclear with only two election cycles under current boundaries, but the data suggests **slight Democratic improvement**.

| Metric | 2022 | 2024 | Change |
|--------|------|------|--------|
| House Dem Votes | 36,242 | 42,468 | +6,226 votes (+17.2%) |
| House Dem % (General) | 25.9% | 25.4% | -0.5 pts |
| Senate Dem Votes | 0 (no candidate) | 42,555 | +42,555 |
| Senate Dem % (General) | 0% (no candidate) | 37.4% | +37.4 pts (first contest) |
| Total House Votes Cast | 139,694 | 167,160 | +27,466 (+19.7%) |

**Key observations:**
1. House Democratic RAW VOTES increased by 6,226 (from 36,242 to 42,468) — a 17% increase — even as the percentage held steady at ~25%. This means the Dem candidate kept pace with overall turnout growth.
2. The Senate race going from unopposed (R) to contested (62.6-37.4 R) in 2024 is a major shift — Bob Karp got 42,555 votes, nearly identical to Frostrom's House total (42,468), but with a dramatically higher percentage (37.4% vs. 25.4%) because it was a two-way race vs. a three-way race.
3. **The two-way vs. three-way math is crucial:** In a House race with 2R + 1D, the Democratic candidate needs only ~34% to win ONE seat. In 2024, Frostrom got 25.4% — an 8.6-point gap. But Karp's Senate performance (37.4% in a two-way race) shows the underlying Democratic vote is higher than the House percentage suggests.

### Comprehensive County-Level Cross-Election Comparison

#### Cochise County — Democratic Performance Over Time

| Race | Year | Dem Candidate | Dem Votes | Dem % | R Margin |
|------|------|---------------|-----------|-------|----------|
| President | 2020 | Biden | 23,732 | 39.3% | R+19.5 |
| US Senate | 2020 | Kelly | 24,843 | 41.4% | R+17.2 |
| Governor | 2022 | Hobbs | 19,137 | 41.1% | R+17.8 |
| President | 2024 | Harris | 22,296 | 37.7% | R+23.1 |
| US Senate | 2024 | Gallego | 23,347 | 40.2% | R+16.9 |

> Cochise trend: Democratic share ranges 37.7-41.4%. Best Dem performance: Kelly 2020 (41.4%). Military candidates outperform. The Gallego 2024 result (40.2%) with 23,347 votes is the floor a strong D candidate can expect.

#### Graham County — Democratic Performance Over Time

| Race | Year | Dem Candidate | Dem Votes | Dem % | R Margin |
|------|------|---------------|-----------|-------|----------|
| President | 2020 | Biden | 4,034 | 26.9% | R+44.8 |
| US Senate | 2020 | Kelly | 4,506 | 30.4% | R+39.2 |
| Governor | 2022 | Hobbs | 3,087 | 28.5% | R+43.0 |
| President | 2024 | Harris | — | ~24.8% | R+48.6 |
| US Senate | 2024 | Gallego | 4,235 | 28.3% | R+41.0 |

> Graham: Deep red. Best Dem: Kelly at 30.4%. Small population limits total vote gain. Not a priority for mobilization.

#### Greenlee County — Democratic Performance Over Time

| Race | Year | Dem Candidate | Dem Votes | Dem % | R Margin |
|------|------|---------------|-----------|-------|----------|
| President | 2020 | Biden | 1,182 | 32.1% | R+33.9 |
| US Senate | 2020 | Kelly | 1,403 | 38.7% | R+22.6 |
| Governor | 2022 | Hobbs | 920 | 37.6% | R+24.8 |
| President | 2024 | Harris | — | ~38.1% | R+22.1 |
| US Senate | 2024 | Gallego | 1,102 | 33.6% | R+29.7 |

> Greenlee: Very small county but notable that Kelly got 38.7% (best Dem performance). Mining union heritage still shows in non-presidential races. Harris's ~38.1% 2024 is surprisingly strong for a presidential race here.

#### Pima County (ENTIRE COUNTY, not just LD-19 portion)

| Race | Year | Dem Candidate | Dem Votes | Dem % | D Margin |
|------|------|---------------|-----------|-------|----------|
| President | 2020 | Biden | 304,981 | 58.6% | D+18.7 |
| US Senate | 2020 | Kelly | 309,142 | 59.9% | D+19.8 |
| Governor | 2022 | Hobbs | 241,398 | 60.6% | D+21.2 |
| President | 2024 | Harris | 292,450 | ~55.1% | D+11.6 |
| US Senate | 2024 | Gallego | 298,751 | 59.1% | D+20.9 |

> Pima shifted right in 2024 presidential (D+18.7 to D+11.6), but Gallego held the D+20.9 margin. The LD-19 portions (Vail, Green Valley) are much more conservative than the county average — likely R+10-20 in those precincts.

#### Santa Cruz County (ENTIRE COUNTY, not just LD-19 portion)

| Race | Year | Dem Candidate | Dem Votes | Dem % | D Margin |
|------|------|---------------|-----------|-------|----------|
| President | 2020 | Biden | 13,138 | 67.2% | D+35.5 |
| US Senate | 2020 | Kelly | 13,689 | 70.7% | D+41.4 |
| Governor | 2022 | Hobbs | 8,724 | 66.6% | D+33.2 |
| President | 2024 | Harris | — | — | D+~8 [VERIFY] |
| US Senate | 2024 | Gallego | 11,986 | 63.0% | D+29.0 |

> Santa Cruz experienced the LARGEST rightward shift of any county in 2024 (~9+ points Republican from 2020 in presidential). Border immigration politics hit hard here. But Gallego still won by 29 points. The LD-19 portion (Patagonia/Sonoita) is more conservative than Nogales-area precincts.

### Statewide Trend Context

Arizona has been trending purple statewide:
- 2020: Biden won AZ by 0.3%, Kelly won Senate by 2.4%
- 2022: Hobbs won Governor by 0.7%, multiple statewide D victories
- 2024: Trump won AZ by 5.5%, Gallego won Senate by 2.0%

The statewide rightward shift in 2024 (+5.8 pts presidential) did NOT appear to worsen the LD-19 House results significantly (D went from 25.9% to 25.4%, only -0.5 pts). This suggests the Democratic candidate in 2024 may have actually been slightly more effective relative to the environment.

### Where Are Democrats Performing Best?

Based on community demographics and county-level trends:

1. **Green Valley** (Pima/Santa Cruz) — Retirement community with healthcare concerns, water issues, more transplants from blue states
2. **Patagonia** (Santa Cruz) — Small but strongly progressive-leaning arts/environmental community
3. **Sierra Vista** (Cochise) — The city is more moderate than Cochise County overall; military families are more diverse and education-focused
4. **Fort Huachuca** (Cochise) — Active military installation; younger, more diverse than surrounding area
5. **Clifton/Morenci** (Greenlee) — Historic mining union towns; Greenlee County voted Democratic from 1912-1996 before the union was broken

### Where Are the Swing Precincts?

Potential swing precincts (where a strong candidate with good messaging could move numbers):

1. **Vail precincts** — $121K median income, well-educated, suburban growth corridor. These voters rejected incorporation (skeptical of government) but are not culture warriors. Economic messaging about infrastructure and schools could work.
2. **Green Valley precincts** — Medicare, Social Security, water table decline, healthcare access are all Democratic-favorable issues with seniors. But cultural conservatism runs deep.
3. **Sierra Vista city precincts** — Fort Huachuca's economic uncertainty (BRAC vulnerability), healthcare access (nearest major hospital is Tucson), education quality all create Democratic openings.
4. **Benson/St. David area** — Working-class railroad town, some agricultural workers, water concerns.

### Turnout Patterns

| County | 2020 General | 2022 General | 2024 General |
|--------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Cochise** | ~74% | ~61% | **72.35%** (82,242 registered, 59,501 ballots) |
| **Graham** | [DATA GAP] | [DATA GAP] | **73.99%** |
| **Greenlee** | [DATA GAP] | [DATA GAP] | [DATA GAP] |
| **Pima** | [DATA GAP] | [DATA GAP] | [DATA GAP] |

Sources: Cochise County official report, Herald Review, Graham County Ballotpedia.

**Patterns observed:**
- **Cochise 2020 vs 2024:** 74% down to 72.35% — slight decline despite both being presidential years. This could reflect population changes, registration list maintenance, or voter disengagement.
- **Cochise 2022 midterm:** Only 61% — an 11+ point drop from presidential years. The midterm drop-off is the key variable for 2026 planning.
- **2026 is a midterm (gubernatorial year):** Expect turnout closer to 2022 levels (~61%) than 2024 (~72%). This typically benefits Republicans in red districts, BUT a motivated Democratic base with a strong local candidate could disproportionately turn out.

**Expected patterns based on demographics:**
- **Highest turnout:** Green Valley (retirees vote at very high rates), Vail (affluent = high turnout)
- **Lowest turnout:** Younger communities in Safford/Thatcher area, Clifton/Morenci (working-class, historically low turnout), unincorporated rural areas
- **Presidential year surge:** Mining communities and younger populations likely show larger presidential-year turnout bump
- **Early voting dominant:** Arizona is largely early/mail-vote state; expect 70-80%+ of votes cast early

### Early Voting vs. Election Day Patterns

[DATA GAP — Need county-level early/election-day breakdown by precinct]

**Arizona context:** Arizona has been a heavy mail-ballot state for years. In 2024, early voting (including mail) accounted for ~80% of all votes statewide. LD-19 likely mirrors this.

### 2022 Candidates

| Office | Candidate | Party | Votes | Performance | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|-------|-------------|-------|
| House | **Sanda Clark** | D | 36,242 | 25.9% | [Background details unknown] |
| Senate | **None filed** | D | N/A | N/A | No Democratic candidate filed — Gowan ran unopposed |

### Assessment: Paper Candidates vs. Active Campaigns

**CRITICAL FINDINGS from Herald Review (Sierra Vista) article, October 2024:**

The Sierra Vista Herald Review ran an article titled **"Democrat could still win LD19 House seat but his party is focused on other races"** which revealed:

1. **The Arizona Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee decided months ago to withhold significant support from the LD-19 House race.** Party leadership did not view this district as a priority for resource allocation in 2024.

2. **Frostrom was NOT a paper candidate** — he had a campaign website, platform, and was described as a legitimate candidate. The article described a grassroots Democratic tactic to encourage voters to cast ballots "only for Frostrom" — attempting to exploit the two-seat House race structure where strategic single-bullet voting could theoretically let one Democrat beat the weaker of two Republicans.

3. **The state party abandoned the district** despite a local strategy existing. This is a critical distinction: the local activist base saw an opportunity, but institutional support was absent.

**Assessment by candidate:**
- **Gregg Frostrom Jr. (2024 House):** Semi-active candidate. Had platform, website, military credentials. But lacked party funding/infrastructure. Still got 42,468 votes (25.4%).
- **Bob Karp (2024 Senate):** More established local figure (Sierra Vista). Got 42,555 votes (37.4%) — dramatically overperforming the House candidate by 12 points percentage-wise. This gap strongly suggests Karp ran a more visible/active campaign than Frostrom.
- **Sanda Clark (2022 House):** Unknown activity level. Got 36,242 votes (25.9%).

**The strategic implication remains enormous:** Even a semi-active Democrat with zero state party support got 25% (House) or 37% (Senate). A fully-funded, actively campaigning Democrat with state party backing has NEVER been tested in the new LD-19. The ceiling is genuinely unknown.

### 2020 and Earlier (Different District)

The pre-2022 LD-19 was a completely different district in the Phoenix metro area:
- 2020: Democratic incumbents Mark Cardenas and Diego Espinoza
- 2016: Both ran unopposed as Democrats
- Not relevant to current boundaries

**For the territory that is NOW LD-19, prior to 2022:**
- The areas were split across old LD-14 (Cochise), LD-1 (Graham/Greenlee), and LD-2 (Pima portions)
- [DATA GAP: Need to research Democratic candidates in those old districts]

## 9. ACTIVE POLITICAL ORGANIZATIONS

### County Democratic Parties

| Organization | County | Status | Notes |
|-------------|--------|--------|-------|
| **Cochise County Democratic Party** | Cochise | **Active** | See detailed profile below |
| Graham County Democratic Party | Graham | [UNKNOWN] | May be dormant — extremely low D registration |
| Greenlee County Democratic Party | Greenlee | [UNKNOWN] | Historically Democratic county but party infrastructure may be gone since union era ended |
| Pima County Democratic Party | Pima | Active (strong) | Covers Vail/Green Valley portions of LD-19 |
| Santa Cruz County Democratic Party | Santa Cruz | Active | Covers Patagonia/Sonoita portions |

#### Cochise County Democratic Party — Detailed Profile

- **Website:** cochisecodems.org
- **Office:** Sierra Vista (staffed hours Mon-Fri 10AM-4PM)
- **Phone:** (520) 255-6430
- **Email:** ccdpsocial@gmail.com
- **Treasurer:** Kathy Buonocore (only named officer found publicly)
- **Chair:** [Not publicly listed on website — would need direct contact]
- **Activity level:** Active. The party held a meeting on December 6, 2025 featuring **LD-19 candidates Jackie Anderson and Aiden Swallow** (likely 2026 candidates), indicating they are already engaged in 2026 cycle planning.
- **Affiliated clubs:** Mule Mountain Democratic Club (MMDC) and other local chapters
- **Infrastructure:** Has an Executive Board, regular PC (Precinct Committee Person) briefings and training sessions

> **2026 CANDIDATE SIGNAL:** The fact that the Cochise County Democrats hosted LD-19 candidates Jackie Anderson and Aiden Swallow in December 2025 indicates that Democratic candidates ARE running in LD-19 for 2026. This is important context for the Ramirez campaign.

### Progressive/Allied Organizations

[DATA GAP — All of these need direct research]

| Organization | Type | Likely Active in LD-19? |
|-------------|------|------------------------|
| Indivisible Southern Arizona | Grassroots advocacy | Possible (Tucson-based, may cover Vail/Green Valley) |
| Planned Parenthood Advocates of AZ | Reproductive rights | Likely active post-Dobbs; Prop 139 passed 61.6% statewide |
| LUCHA (Living United for Change in AZ) | Latino voter mobilization | Possible in Cochise/Santa Cruz portions |
| UNITE HERE (hospitality workers union) | Labor | Unlikely in LD-19 |
| Arizona Education Association | Teachers union | Possible in school districts across LD-19 |
| Sierra Club Grand Canyon Chapter | Environmental | Possible (mining/water issues) |
| **Mule Mountain Democratic Club (MMDC)** | Social/political (Bisbee area) | **Confirmed active** — affiliated with Cochise County Democratic Party |
| Green Valley Democrats | Local club | [NEEDS VERIFICATION — if it exists, this would be a key ally] |
| SOMOS (Safford-area) | Latino community | [NEEDS VERIFICATION] |
| Steelworkers Local (Morenci) | Mining labor | Historically significant; status unknown post-Phelps Dodge era |

### PACs Operating in LD-19

[DATA GAP — Need to search OpenSecrets/FollowTheMoney for PAC spending in LD-19 races]

**Expected active PACs:**
- Arizona Chamber of Commerce (supports Rs)
- Freeport-McMoRan PAC (mining industry)
- National Rifle Association (strong in rural AZ)
- Realtors PAC (active in Vail/growth areas)
- Arizona Farm Bureau
- Any progressive PAC spending would be notable given district lean

## 10. STRATEGIC IMPLICATIONS

### The 25% Floor, 37% Ceiling Question

The data reveals a fascinating split:
- **House Democratic floor: ~25%** (with minimal/paper candidates)
- **Senate Democratic ceiling: 37.4%** (with at least one contested candidate in 2024)

This 12-point gap between House and Senate Democratic performance in 2024 suggests:
1. The Senate Democratic candidate may have been slightly more active/visible than the House candidate
2. OR voters were more willing to cross over in a single-winner Senate race than in a two-winner House race
3. OR the Senate candidate benefited from anti-Gowan sentiment

### The Path to Competitiveness

From 25% to a win requires moving ~26+ points (to get to ~51% in a two-way Senate race, or to be one of two winners in a three-way House race needing ~34%+ to win a seat).

**House math (easier path):**
- Current D performance: ~25%
- Needed to win one of two seats: ~34% (if 3 candidates total)
- Gap to close: ~9 points
- This means converting ~7,000-8,000 voters from R to D, or mobilizing ~7,000 new voters

**Senate math (harder path):**
- Current D performance: ~37% (2024, only data point)
- Needed to win: ~50.1%
- Gap to close: ~13 points

### The 33% Independent Bloc

With 33% of voters registered Independent, the math changes:
- If a Democratic candidate could win 70% of Independents (aggressive but not impossible with right message)
- And hold 90% of registered Democrats
- They would need only ~5-10% of Republican crossover
- Combined: 24% x 0.9 + 33% x 0.7 + 43% x 0.07 = 21.6 + 23.1 + 3.0 = **47.7%** (still short for Senate)
- With 10% R crossover: 21.6 + 23.1 + 4.3 = **49.0%** (almost there)

## 11. DATA COLLECTION PRIORITIES (NEXT STEPS)

### Highest Priority (Week 1)

1. ~~Identify the 2024 Senate Democratic candidate~~ **DONE: Bob Karp**
2. ~~Identify the 2022 House Democratic candidate~~ **DONE: Sanda Clark**
3. **Download 2024 canvass reports from all 5 counties** — precinct-level results for ALL races (county-level data now obtained; precinct-level still needed)
4. **Pull Prop 139 (abortion) results by precinct in LD-19** — This is the single most revealing data point for crossover potential
5. **Pull 2024 presidential and Senate results by precinct** — Identify ticket-splitters (county-level now available; precinct-level needed)
6. **Get exact vote totals for Graham, Greenlee, Santa Cruz presidential 2024** — Have percentages but not all raw vote counts

### Medium Priority (Week 2)

7. **AZ Secretary of State voter registration file** — Detailed party registration by precinct
8. **Contact Cochise County Democratic Party** — Get ground truth; ask about Jackie Anderson and Aiden Swallow (2026 LD-19 candidates)
9. **Search for Green Valley Democrats club/group** — Potential organizing base
10. **OpenSecrets/FollowTheMoney** — Who funded Griffin, Diaz, Gowan? Who funded the Democratic candidates?
11. **Verify Santa Cruz County 2024 presidential data** — Conflicting reports about whether Trump won or Harris held it

### Lower Priority (Week 3-4)

12. **Early vs. election day voting splits** by precinct
13. **Turnout analysis** by precinct — where are the non-voters?
14. **Historical mining union vote** — Can Greenlee's Democratic heritage be revived?
15. **Military voter analysis** — Fort Huachuca voting patterns
16. **Senior voter analysis** — Green Valley voting patterns
