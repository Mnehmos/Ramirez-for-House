## 1. DEMOGRAPHICS

### 1.1 Population Trends

| Census Year | Population | Change | Growth Rate |
|------------|-----------|--------|-------------|
| 2000 | 17,283 | -- | -- |
| 2010 | 21,391 | +4,108 | +23.8% |
| 2020 | 22,616 | +1,225 | +5.7% |

**Trend:** Growth has slowed significantly. The community added ~4,100 residents in the 2000s (likely new retirement subdivision development) but only ~1,200 in the 2010s. Green Valley is approaching buildout -- most available land for residential development is constrained by surrounding mines and federal/state land. Growth is now primarily replacement (new retirees buying from departing/deceased residents) rather than new construction.

**Population Density:** 663.4 people per sq mi (2010), approximately 860 per sq mi (2020)

### 1.2 Age Distribution

| Age Group | 2000 Census | 2023 ACS (est.) |
|-----------|------------|-----------------|
| Under 18 | 1.6% | ~2% |
| 18-24 | 0.7% | ~1% |
| 25-44 | 2.8% | ~3% |
| 45-64 | 21.7% | ~16% |
| 65+ | **73.3%** | **~79.8%** |

**Median Age:** 72 years (2000 Census); **73.3 years confirmed** (2023 ACS 5-year estimates -- 73.9 male, 72.7 female). The median age is 96% higher than Arizona's state median of 38.8.

**Key Insight:** This is one of the oldest communities in the United States by median age. The 65+ share has actually *increased* from 73.3% to approximately 79.8% over two decades, as the community ages in place and younger cohorts have not replaced departing residents. Nearly four out of five residents are Medicare-eligible seniors. Only ~2% are under 18 -- there are virtually no families with school-age children living in Green Valley proper. Only 2% of households have children under 18, far below the national average.

**Gender Ratio:** 79.7 males per 100 females (reflects women's longer life expectancy in retirement communities)

### 1.3 Racial/Ethnic Composition

| Race/Ethnicity | 2000 | 2010 | 2020/2023 ACS | Trend |
|---------------|------|------|--------------|-------|
| Non-Hispanic White | 98.4% | 93.4% | **92.0%** | Declining slowly |
| Hispanic/Latino | 2.3% | 4.9% | **5.36%** (1,160 persons) | Growing |
| Black/African American | 0.2% | 0.4% | 0.6% (121 persons) | Stable |
| Native American | 0.2% | 0.3% | 0.4% (89 persons) | Stable |
| Asian | 0.3% | 0.7% | 0.68% (146 persons) | Stable |
| Two or More Races | 0.5% | 0.7% | 3.3% (711 persons) | Growing |

**Key Insight:** Green Valley is overwhelmingly white (92%) but diversifying slowly. The Hispanic/Latino population more than doubled from 2.3% to 5.36% between 2000-2023, likely reflecting both new retirees of Hispanic heritage and some service-sector workers living in adjacent areas counted within the CDP boundary. This is dramatically less diverse than Arizona overall (30.7% Hispanic statewide). The Two or More Races category has grown most significantly, from 0.7% to 3.3%, likely reflecting evolving self-identification among retirees.

### 1.4 Veterans Population

**Confirmed: 22% of the 18+ civilian population are veterans** (~3,952 total veterans -- 3,724 male, 228 female). This is nearly 3x the national average (7.5%) and more than double Arizona's average (9.2%).

**Service era breakdown:** The community has a particularly large population of **Vietnam-era veterans** -- 5.92 times greater than any other conflict category. This demographic detail is significant for messaging (Agent Orange/VA healthcare, Vietnam Veterans Memorial recognition, etc.).

Many military retirees choose Green Valley for its:
- Proximity to Davis-Monthan Air Force Base (Tucson, ~35 miles north)
- Proximity to Fort Huachuca (~60 miles east)
- Low cost of living relative to other Arizona retirement communities
- Access to VA Southern Arizona Health Care System (Tucson)
- Green Valley VA Clinic (outpatient services available locally)

**Campaign Relevance:** Veterans are a major constituency -- nearly 1 in 4 adults. Issues around VA healthcare access, military pensions, and patriotic messaging resonate strongly. The Vietnam-era veteran dominance means Agent Orange exposure, PTSD recognition, and VA benefits modernization are particularly salient.

### 1.5 Educational Attainment

Green Valley residents are well-educated relative to national and Arizona averages:
- **High school diploma or higher:** **95.9%** (confirmed via ACS)
- **Bachelor's degree or higher:** **43.0%** (confirmed -- higher than previously estimated)
- **Master's degree or higher:** **19.6%**

**Detailed breakdown (ages 25+):**
- High school only: 23.1%
- Some college: 23.8%
- Associate degree: 7.9%
- Bachelor's degree: 24.2%
- Master's/Doctorate: 19.6%

This reflects the demographic profile of retirees who could afford to relocate to a planned retirement community -- predominantly middle-class and upper-middle-class professionals, educators, military officers, and civil servants. Nearly 1 in 5 residents holds a graduate degree, significantly above state and national averages.

### 1.6 Household Size

- **Average household size (2000):** 1.71 persons
- **Average family size (2000):** 2.07 persons
- **Households with children under 18:** 1.5%
- **Married couples:** 59.8%
- **Non-families (living alone or with non-relatives):** 37.0%
- **Individuals living alone 65+:** 28.5%

**Key Insight:** Nearly one-third of all households are elderly people living alone. This has profound implications for isolation, healthcare access, transportation needs, and vulnerability to scams/exploitation.

## 2. ECONOMICS

### 2.1 Income Profile

| Metric | 2000 Census | 2014 ACS | 2023 ACS | Notes |
|--------|------------|----------|----------|-------|
| Median Household Income | $40,213 | $46,732 | **$58,268** | Below AZ median ($76,872) |
| Median Family Income | $48,369 | -- | -- | Higher due to dual-income couples |
| Per Capita Income | $31,138 | $35,416 | **$47,699** (±$2,856) | Relatively high due to small households |
| Male Median Income | $34,500 | -- | -- | |
| Female Median Income | $25,932 | -- | -- | |

**Income Sources (2023 ACS -- CONFIRMED):**
- **83.7% of households receive Social Security** -- the highest rate among Southern Arizona communities
- **68.1% of households receive retirement income** -- CONFIRMED, matching the LD-19 district profile claim
- **Only 24.7% of households have earned wage/salary income** -- the lowest rate in the region
- **56.8% of the population is on Medicare**, reflecting the massive senior population

Green Valley's economy is fundamentally a **retirement transfer economy** -- the vast majority of household income comes from:
- Social Security (83.7% of households)
- Private pensions (military, corporate, government) -- 68.1% of households
- Investment/retirement account withdrawals (401k, IRA distributions)
- VA disability payments

**This means the community's economic health is directly and almost exclusively tied to federal policy on Social Security, Medicare, and pension protections. Any proposed changes to these programs are not abstract policy debates here -- they are immediate pocketbook threats.**

### 2.2 Poverty

| Metric | 2000 Census | 2014 ACS | 2023 ACS | Notes |
|--------|------------|----------|----------|-------|
| Overall poverty rate | 3.0% | 4.6% | **8.51%** | Rising significantly |
| Family poverty rate | 1.7% | -- | **4.5%** | Doubled+ since 2000 |
| Poverty rate, under 18 | 3.1% | -- | -- | Tiny population |
| Poverty rate, 65+ | 2.8% | -- | -- | Rising concern |

**Key Insight:** Poverty is rising in Green Valley. The overall rate has nearly tripled from 3.0% (2000) to 8.51% (2023 ACS). While still below many communities, this upward trend reflects the compounding pressure of:
- Fixed-income erosion from inflation (Social Security COLAs not keeping pace with actual costs)
- Rising property taxes on fixed incomes
- Healthcare costs not covered by Medicare (dental, vision, hearing, long-term care)
- Many seniors are "asset-rich, cash-poor" (own their home but have limited monthly income)
- Widowed individuals losing spousal Social Security benefits

**Campaign Relevance:** The tripling of the poverty rate is a powerful data point. "Poverty among Green Valley seniors has tripled in two decades while mining companies post record profits" is a resonant frame.

### 2.3 Housing

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Total Housing Units (2010) | 17,322 | Census |
| Housing Units (2000) | 13,263 | Census |
| Avg Housing Density | 505.4/sq mi | 2000 Census |
| Homeownership Rate | **86.2%** (confirmed) | ACS -- above national avg (65%) |
| Median Home Value (2023 ACS) | **$264,300** | Census ACS 5-year |
| Median Home Sale Price (Nov 2025) | **$293,000** | Redfin (up 6.5% YoY) |
| Median Rent | **$1,600-$1,740** | Zillow/multiple sources |
| Effective Property Tax Rate | **0.73%** | Below national median (1.02%), above AZ median (0.56%) |

**Key Insight:** Green Valley has extremely high homeownership (86.2%). Most residents purchased homes outright or with mortgages now paid off. The 17,322 housing units for 21,391 people (2010) yields ~1.24 persons per unit, reflecting the large number of snowbird/seasonal properties that are unoccupied part of the year. Home values have appreciated significantly -- up 6.5% year-over-year as of late 2025 -- which is good for equity but increases property tax burdens on fixed-income seniors.

### 2.4 Major Employers

| Employer | Sector | Significance |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| **Freeport-McMoRan (Sierrita Mine)** | Copper Mining | Largest private employer in area; open-pit copper/molybdenum mine immediately adjacent to Green Valley |
| **ASARCO (Mission Mine)** | Copper Mining | Second major mine, also adjacent |
| **Green Valley Recreation (GVR)** | Recreation Services | Major employer of staff for 14 recreation centers |
| **~~Santa Cruz Valley Regional Hospital~~** | Healthcare | **CLOSED June 30, 2022** -- see Section 4.2 |
| **Walmart/Retail** | Retail | Major retail center along I-19 corridor |
| **Fry's/Safeway** | Grocery | Multiple locations |
| **Green Valley Fire District** | Fire/EMS | (Now Santa Rita Fire District) |
| **Continental Elementary School District** | Education | Small district |
| **Farmers Investment Co. (FICO)** | Agriculture | Pecan farming, significant water user |
| **Pima County** | Government | County services, sheriff patrols |

**Employment Sector Breakdown (2023 ACS, for GV residents):**
| Sector | Workers | Share |
|--------|---------|-------|
| Health Care & Social Assistance | 596 | Largest |
| Retail Trade | 466 | Second |
| Professional/Scientific/Technical | 261 | Third |

- Total employed workforce: **3,135** (only ~14.5% of population, reflecting retirement dominance)
- Employment rate among workers: 97.2%
- 86.7% of workers are in professional/administrative positions; 13.3% in service/hands-on jobs
- Employment grew 5.73% from 2022 to 2023 (2,970 to 3,135)

**Sierrita Mine Details:** Freeport-McMoRan's Sierrita mine is an open-pit copper and molybdenum mining complex located ~7 miles west of Green Valley. It also produces rhenium, a rare and highly valued metal. The mine has a dedicated Mine Training Institute with classrooms, lab space, and simulators. It is one of six copper mines Freeport-McMoRan operates in the United States.

**Key Insight:** The mines are the 800-pound gorilla. Freeport-McMoRan's Sierrita Mine and ASARCO's Mission Mine provide jobs, property tax revenue, and community investment -- but they also consume massive amounts of groundwater (85% of aquifer pumping goes to mining/agriculture), create dust and noise, and raise environmental health concerns. The Sierrita mine has a sulfate plume spreading east from the mine site toward residential areas.

### 2.5 Tourism Economy

Green Valley is a gateway to significant tourist destinations:
- **Madera Canyon:** Premier birding destination in the Santa Rita Mountains; one of the top birding spots in North America (Elegant Trogon, over 250 species documented)
- **Titan Missile Museum:** America's only preserved Titan II ICBM silo, located in Green Valley; a major Cold War heritage attraction
- **Tubac:** Historic arts colony ~10 miles south; annual Tubac Festival of the Arts draws thousands
- **Tumacacori National Historical Park:** Spanish colonial mission, ~20 miles south
- **Sonoita/Elgin Wine Country:** Arizona's emerging wine region, ~30 miles east
- **Birding:** Green Valley sits in the "Birding Triangle" of southeastern Arizona

Tourism provides supplemental economic activity through restaurants, hotels, and retail, but is not the primary economic driver.

## 3. GOVERNANCE (CRITICAL)

### 3.1 Unincorporated Status -- What It Means

Green Valley has **no city government**. It is an unincorporated census-designated place, meaning:
- **No mayor, no city council, no city manager**
- **No municipal police department** (law enforcement by Pima County Sheriff)
- **No city zoning board** (Pima County handles land use/zoning)
- **No city-level taxation** (residents pay county property taxes, not city taxes)
- **No municipal services** (no city parks department, no city utilities, no city roads department)

All government services come from **Pima County**, supplemented by **special districts** and **private community organizations** that fill the gaps.

### 3.2 The Green Valley Council (GVC)

**Website:** https://gvcouncil.org
**Founded:** 1973 (celebrated 50th anniversary in 2023)
**Type:** Voluntary community association (501(c)(4) nonprofit)

The Green Valley Council is the closest thing Green Valley has to a local government, but it has **no taxing authority, no police power, and no regulatory jurisdiction**. It functions as:

- **Community voice:** Represents Green Valley's interests to Pima County government
- **Coordination body:** Coordinates among the community's many HOAs
- **Civic engagement hub:** Organizes community forums, candidate events, informational meetings
- **Advocacy organization:** Lobbies county/state/federal officials on behalf of GV residents

**Structure:**
- Member HOAs pay dues to belong to the GVC
- The GVC has a board of directors elected from member HOA representatives
- Standing committees (health & wellness, community affairs, etc.)
- The GVC Foundation (separate 501(c)(3)) handles charitable activities

**Key Navigation Links Found:**
- HOA Portal (directory of member HOAs)
- Boards & Committees
- Community Partners
- Events Calendar
- The Foundation (gvc-foundation.org)

**Campaign Relevance:** The GVC is the gateway to organized civic life in Green Valley. Any candidate must present to and be endorsed by (or at least neutral with) the GVC. Their community forums and events are the primary venue for political engagement.

### 3.3 The HOA Structure

Wikipedia notes Green Valley is composed of **59 Homeowner Associations** (the research plan cites 100+, which likely includes sub-associations and smaller entities within larger master-planned communities).

Each HOA is an independent corporation with:
- Its own elected board of directors
- Its own CC&Rs (covenants, conditions, and restrictions)
- Its own dues structure
- Its own rules for property maintenance, architectural standards, etc.

The GVC has a dedicated "HOA Lister" plugin on its website, suggesting it maintains a directory of all member HOAs.

**Campaign Relevance:** HOA boards are microcosms of local politics. Board presidents are community influencers who can facilitate or block candidate access to their neighborhoods. Understanding the HOA governance structure is essential for canvassing strategy.

### 3.4 Pima County Board of Supervisors

Green Valley falls within **Pima County Supervisorial District 4**.

**Current Supervisor: Steve Christy (R)**
- Elected to a third term in November 2024 (defeated Democrat Vanessa Bechtol)
- Lifelong Tucsonan, 1976 graduate of American University (Political Science)
- In his ninth year of service
- District 4 includes: Tucson's East Side, Mount Lemmon, Vail, Corona de Tucson, Saguaro National Park East, Green Valley, and La Cienega National Conservation Area
- **District voter registration:** 36% Republican, 31% Democrat, 33% Independent/Other

**Note on Pima County Board:** Rex Scott (District 1) serves as Board Chair (2025-2026). The full board composition is: District 1 - Rex Scott, District 2 - Dr. Matt Heinz, District 3 - [vacant/appointed], District 4 - Steve Christy, District 5 - Andres Cano (appointed April 2025 to replace Adelita Grijalva).

The Pima County Board of Supervisors provides:
- Law enforcement (Pima County Sheriff's Department -- Green Valley substation)
- Road maintenance
- Land use planning and zoning
- Environmental services
- Public health
- Libraries (Green Valley Library)

### 3.5 Santa Cruz County Overlap

A small portion of the greater Green Valley area extends into Santa Cruz County. The CDP boundary as defined by the Census is primarily in Pima County, but the economic and social sphere of influence extends south into Santa Cruz County (Tubac, Tumacacori, Rio Rico).

### 3.6 Fire and Emergency Services

**Santa Rita Fire District** (formerly Green Valley Fire District -- rebranded July 1, 2025)

**Fire Chief:** Chuck Wunder
**Website:** https://srfdaz.gov (formerly gvfire.org)

The name change to "Santa Rita Fire District" was adopted by the Board of Directors to better reflect the expanded service area after the district took on responsibility for northern Sahuarita through annexation (approved October 2023).

The fire district is an independent special taxing district that provides:
- Fire suppression
- Emergency medical services (EMS/ambulance)
- Hazardous materials response
- Community risk reduction
- Greater Green Valley CERT (Community Emergency Response Team) operates under the district

The fire district covers Green Valley and the neighboring Town of Sahuarita. It is governed by an elected board of directors and funded through property tax assessments.

### 3.7 Water Providers

Water in the Green Valley area is provided by a patchwork of entities:

| Provider | Type | Service Area | Address |
|----------|------|-------------|---------|
| **Community Water Company of Green Valley** | Nonprofit Arizona corporation | Core Green Valley + portions of Sahuarita | 1501 S. La Canada Dr, GV 85622 |
| **Green Valley Domestic Water Improvement District** | Governmental water utility | Parts of GV | 3200 S Camino Del Sol, GV 85622 |
| **Farmers Water Company** | Private (for-profit) | Areas near FICO farms | -- |
| **Sahuarita Water Company** | Private | Sahuarita/south areas | -- |
| **Las Quintas Serenas Water Company** | Private | Specific subdivision | -- |
| **Quail Creek Water Company** | Private | Quail Creek community | -- |

**Critical Note:** Community Water Company and the Green Valley Water District are the **only CAP (Central Arizona Project) entitlement holders** south and upstream of Tucson. This gives them strategic importance in the regional water security picture.

**Project RENEWS:** Community Water Company is constructing a pipeline and underground water storage facility to bring Colorado River water (via CAP) to Green Valley and Sahuarita. This is a critical infrastructure project to offset aquifer decline.

**Key Organization:** The **Upper Santa Cruz Providers and Users Group (USCPUG)** was established in 2007 to bring all local water entities to the table. Members include the Town of Sahuarita and most water users/utilities. USCPUG has partnered with the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation to plan CAP water delivery to reduce groundwater pumping.

### 3.8 Education

- **Sahuarita Unified School District (SUSD):** Serves ~6,300+ students across ~606 square miles. Operates four elementary schools, two K-8 schools, one middle school, two high schools, an alternative secondary school, one fully online school, and an early childhood center. Covers Green Valley and Sahuarita.
- **Continental Elementary School District:** Smaller district serving ~500 students (pre-school through 8th grade) in Sahuarita's Madera Highlands and Madera Reserve neighborhoods. Received "Excelling School" designation from Arizona Department of Education in 2007. Home of the Continental Colts.
- Given that only ~2% of Green Valley's population is under 18, these districts primarily serve Sahuarita's younger families rather than Green Valley's retirement population. However, Green Valley residents still pay property taxes that fund these districts, which can be a point of friction.

### 3.9 Law Enforcement

- **Pima County Sheriff's Department** -- Green Valley substation (pimasheriff.org)
- No municipal police
- Green Valley Neighborhood Watch programs (organized through HOAs)
- The sheriff substation responds to calls, patrols, and provides community policing
- **Crime statistics:** Green Valley is as safe as the state and national averages. The cost of crime per resident is $410/year, which is $54 less than the national average and $42 less than Arizona's average. Overall serious crimes fell slightly in the most recent reporting period.
- Published crime data available at: pimasheriff.org (annual Green Valley crime statistics by zip code)

## 4. KEY ISSUES

### 4.1 Water Table Decline (CRITICAL)

**The single most important long-term issue facing Green Valley.**

Per the 2007 Pima County report (cited in Wikipedia with specific data):

- **76,000 acre-feet** of water pumped from the Upper Santa Cruz Valley aquifer in 2006
- **85% of that water** goes to **mining and agriculture** -- NOT residential use
- Only **15%** is split between golf courses and residential/commercial use
- The report concluded: *"The Green Valley area does not have a sustainable water supply given current groundwater pumping rates"*
- The report warned: *"Water supplies will become critical within the next ten years"* (i.e., by ~2017)

**Major Water Users (all pumping from the same aquifer):**
1. ASARCO Mission Mine (industrial-scale)
2. Freeport-McMoRan Sierrita Mine (industrial-scale)
3. Farmers Investment Co. / FICO (pecan farming, industrial-scale)
4. Golf courses (multiple in Green Valley)
5. Residential water providers (multiple small companies)

**Water Level Decline Rate (CONFIRMED):**
- Water companies serving the Sahuarita-Green Valley area report declines averaging **4.5 feet per year since 1999** and **5 feet per year since 2009**
- In some localized areas, decline reaches **2 feet per year**
- The aquifer suffers from: excessive groundwater pumping, a lack of recharge, AND a **sulfate plume spreading east from the mines** west of I-19

**Mitigation Efforts:**
- The 2007 report recommended bringing Central Arizona Project (CAP) renewable water to the Upper Santa Cruz Basin via a 72-inch pipeline
- As of 2017, one 36-inch CAP pipeline was completed, with a second 36-inch pipeline in progress
- **Critical math:** Two 36-inch pipes provide only **HALF** the capacity of a single 72-inch pipe (capacity scales with cross-sectional area, not diameter)
- **Project RENEWS** (Community Water Company): Currently constructing a pipeline and underground water storage facility to bring Colorado River water to Green Valley -- a direct response to the crisis
- USCPUG has published water use projections through 2030
- Partnership with U.S. Bureau of Reclamation for Colorado River water transport is underway but funding remains the major challenge

**Arizona Water Law Problem:** Arizona water law places **few limits on the amount of water that can be pumped** -- costs are limited only to drilling, pumping, and distribution. This means mining companies can pump virtually unlimited water with no legal constraint, even as the aquifer declines. Green Valley is NOT within an Active Management Area (AMA), meaning it lacks even the basic groundwater regulation that applies to Phoenix and Tucson.

**Campaign Messaging:** This is a powerful issue. Residents' drinking water is literally being drained by mining corporations that contribute to the tax base but threaten the community's long-term viability. A candidate could advocate for:
- Stricter groundwater pumping regulations for industrial users
- Accelerated CAP pipeline construction
- Water recycling mandates for mining operations
- State-level reform of groundwater law

### 4.2 Healthcare Access (CRITICAL -- HOSPITAL CLOSED)

**MAJOR DEVELOPMENT: Santa Cruz Valley Regional Hospital CLOSED June 30, 2022.**

This 49-bed acute care hospital was the **only hospital within 26 miles** of Green Valley. Its closure is one of the most significant quality-of-life crises facing the community.

**Closure Details:**
- Closed June 30, 2022 due to insurmountable debt
- The hospital had been paying back ~$400,000/month in Medicare pandemic advance payments
- TMC HealthCare (Tucson Medical Center) was poised to purchase the facility but **backed out** at the last moment
- The closure eliminated 300 jobs and ended 7 years of local hospital service
- The hospital's ER had been seeing ~50 patients/day
- The facility served roughly **100,000 people** along the I-19 corridor
- **Private equity ownership** collected millions in federal pandemic aid before shuttering -- a politically potent detail

**Reopening Status (as of early 2026):**
- Efforts to reopen have been ongoing since 2022 but **no firm timeline or commitment exists**
- Multiple offers have been received by the broker
- The hospital building at 4455 I-19 Frontage Road remains closed
- Green Valley Buzz reporting suggests reopening is unlikely in the near term

**Current Healthcare Available:**
- **United Community Health Center (UCHC):** Operates 5 primary care clinic sites in Green Valley (plus locations in Amado, Arivaca, Sahuarita, Three Points, Vail). Federally qualified community health center providing primary care -- NOT hospital/emergency services. UCHC at Green Valley Hospital offers Family Practice at 4475 I-19 Frontage Rd, Suite 139.
- **NextCare Urgent Care:** Opened November 2023 at The Crossing at Sahuarita -- urgent care only, not emergency services
- **For emergency/hospital care:** Residents must now drive **25-45 minutes to Tucson** (Banner-University Medical Center, St. Joseph's Hospital, TMC Healthcare)

**Healthcare Concerns:**
- **NO LOCAL EMERGENCY ROOM** -- the most acute concern for a community with a median age of 73.3. Every heart attack, stroke, or fall now requires a 45-minute ambulance ride to Tucson
- **Specialist access:** Limited specialist physicians in Green Valley; most specialty care requires Tucson trips
- **Emergency response times:** Santa Rita Fire District EMS responds locally, but transfer to trauma centers takes 30-45 minutes minimum
- **Medicare dependency:** 56.8% of the population is on Medicare and 97.6% have health coverage; any changes to Medicare coverage, premiums, or provider networks directly impact nearly every household
- **Prescription drug costs:** Major concern for fixed-income seniors on multiple medications
- **Long-term care:** Limited assisted living and memory care facilities relative to population
- **Mental health:** Social isolation among elderly, especially those living alone (28.5% of households); depression and cognitive decline concerns
- **VA healthcare:** Green Valley VA Clinic provides outpatient services; full VA hospital is in Tucson

**Campaign Relevance:** The hospital closure is arguably the single most emotionally resonant issue in Green Valley. "Our seniors lost their only hospital while a private equity firm walked away with millions in federal money" is a message that crosses party lines. Advocating for state-level action to prevent rural hospital closures, support community health infrastructure, and incentivize hospital operations in underserved areas is a powerful platform plank.

### 4.3 Property Taxes and Services Gap

Green Valley's effective property tax rate is **0.73%** -- below the national median (1.02%) but above Arizona's state median (0.56%). Residents pay **Pima County property taxes** but receive a more limited service package than incorporated cities because:
- No municipal services (parks, recreation, code enforcement are handled privately through HOAs and GVR)
- Sheriff patrols cover a large area with limited staffing compared to a city police department
- Road maintenance is county responsibility but lower priority than urban Tucson areas
- No municipal court for quality-of-life violations
- Residents pay into school district taxes despite only ~2% having school-age children

This creates a persistent perception that residents "pay for Tucson's services" while receiving less in return. It is a recurring complaint, amplified by the fact that most residents are on fixed incomes where even small property tax increases are felt acutely. With home values rising (up 6.5% YoY to a median of $293K), property tax assessments are climbing even as monthly income remains fixed.

### 4.4 Incorporation Debate

The question of whether Green Valley should incorporate as a city has come up on an almost cyclical basis but has never gained majority support.

**Legal Barrier (IMPORTANT):** A 1961 Arizona law gives neighboring towns the power to **veto** incorporations. This means any move to incorporate Green Valley would require the **blessing of the Town of Sahuarita**. In 1997, the state Legislature passed a law exempting Pima County from the 1961 law, but the **Arizona Supreme Court declared the 1997 law unconstitutional**. This legal barrier remains in place, effectively giving Sahuarita a veto over Green Valley's incorporation.

**For Incorporation:**
- Local control over zoning, development, and land use
- Dedicated police force (city police vs. county sheriff)
- Ability to set local priorities and budget
- More responsive government for local issues

**Against Incorporation:**
- Would require local taxes (city property tax, sales tax) on top of county taxes
- Residents chose Green Valley specifically to avoid city government overhead
- HOA governance already handles most neighborhood-level issues
- Most residents are on fixed incomes and resistant to any tax increases
- The GVC provides adequate advocacy without the cost of a city bureaucracy
- Green Valley's strong volunteer culture means many services are provided through community self-organization

**Current Status:** Incorporation is not actively being pursued. The legal barrier (Sahuarita's veto power) makes it even less likely. The community has generally preferred the status quo of HOA governance + GVC advocacy + county services. The culture is one of self-reliance: "a culture where people want to do for themselves and help their neighbors."

### 4.5 Transportation for Seniors

**Public Transit:**
- **Sun Shuttle (Route 421):** Provides neighborhood transit service in Green Valley & Sahuarita, and connects to Tucson transit routes. Low-income riders, persons with disabilities, seniors 65+, and Medicare cardholders can apply for the Economy Fare Program.
- **Sun Shuttle Dial-A-Ride:** Door-to-door paratransit service for those who qualify
- **No comprehensive local bus system** within Green Valley neighborhoods

**Volunteer/Nonprofit Transportation:**
- **Friends in Deed:** Provides volunteer driver services for medical appointments and Tucson trips. Call (520) 625-4424, M-F 9am-12pm. Must book 5+ business days in advance.
- **Valley Assistance Services (VAS):** Neighbors Helping Neighbors program -- trained volunteers provide transportation to medical appointments, grocery shopping, and essential errands. Serves Amado, Arivaca, Green Valley, Sahuarita, Tubac, and Tumacacori.

**Private:**
- **Green Valley Transportation Service:** Family-owned taxi/transport service, 24/7. (520) 548-5858.
- **Green Valley Airport Shuttle:** Serves TUS (Tucson International) airport.

**Key Issue:** Car dependency is the defining transportation challenge. Despite the elderly population, most residents drive; when they can no longer drive, mobility becomes a critical quality-of-life issue. With the hospital closure, the transportation burden has intensified -- non-emergency medical transport to Tucson for specialist appointments that used to be available locally is now a 45-minute each-way trip.

### 4.6 Medicare and Social Security

**Confirmed data points:**
- **83.7%** of households receive Social Security (highest rate in Southern Arizona)
- **68.1%** of households receive retirement income
- **56.8%** of the population is on Medicare
- Only **24.7%** of households have earned income
- The nearest Social Security office serves GV zip codes 85614 and 85622

Given these numbers:
- **Any proposed cuts to Social Security are existential threats** to this community -- it is not hyperbole to say that 5 out of 6 households would be directly affected
- **Medicare premium increases** directly impact household budgets
- **Part D prescription drug coverage** is a top concern
- **Social Security COLA adjustments** may not keep pace with actual cost-of-living increases in Arizona (housing up 6.5% YoY, healthcare costs, utilities)
- **SHIP (State Health Insurance Program)** through Pima Council on Aging (520-790-7262, PCOA.org) provides Medicare counseling -- a resource candidates should know about and reference

**Arizona State Retirement System (ASRS)** also affects former state/county/school employees who retired to Green Valley.

This is THE bread-and-butter issue for Green Valley voters and likely the most persuasive campaign message: *"I will fight to protect your Social Security and Medicare."*

### 4.7 HOA Governance Issues

Common complaints in HOA-governed communities apply:
- Board overreach/arbitrary rule enforcement
- Transparency of HOA finances
- Aging infrastructure in older subdivisions (roads, common areas, pools)
- Special assessment fees for major repairs
- HOA fee increases on fixed incomes
- Disputes between residents and boards
- CC&R enforcement inconsistencies

## 5. COMMUNITY ASSETS

### 5.1 Green Valley Recreation (GVR)

**Website:** https://gvrec.org
**Type:** 501(c)(4) nonprofit recreation organization
**Scope:** Owns and operates **15 recreation centers** (updated from 14)
**Membership:** Serves approximately **80% of households** in the Green Valley area
**Annual Fee (2025):** **$530 per household** (all persons on the deed get membership cards)

Key offerings:
- **24-court pickleball center** (award-winning; pickleball is enormously popular in retirement communities)
- Heated indoor and outdoor swimming pools, spas
- State-of-the-art fitness/aerobic/weight resistance centers
- Tennis, basketball, bocce, horseshoes, racquetball, shuffleboard, table tennis, water and sand volleyball
- **60+ activity and social clubs** (woodworking, pottery, photography, computers, etc.)
- **900+ classes annually** (fitness, arts & crafts, dance, music, gardening, cooking, literature, landscaping) at discounted member rates
- Arts and crafts studios
- Performing arts spaces
- Educational programs

**Membership:** Deeded to the property itself -- membership passes from owner to owner each time a property sells. This means virtually all homeowners in GVR communities are automatic members.

**Campaign Relevance:** GVR facilities are the social hub of Green Valley. Community meetings, candidate forums, and voter registration drives should be centered at GVR locations. GVR's 15 centers are natural canvassing anchor points. The $530/year fee is remarkably affordable but represents another annual expense on fixed incomes.

### 5.2 Friends in Deed

**Website:** https://friendsindeedgv.org
**Type:** 501(c)(3) nonprofit, all-volunteer organization
**Founded:** Over 50 years ago -- started in the garage of two nurses
**Location:** 301 W. Camino Casa Verde, Green Valley, AZ 85614
**Phone:** (520) 625-1150
**Volunteers:** 150+ part-time volunteers (no paid employees)
**Funding:** Entirely through community grants and donations

Friends in Deed provides **free** services to Green Valley seniors:
- **Durable medical equipment lending** (the original mission -- still core)
- **Volunteer driver program** (medical appointments, grocery shopping, Tucson trips -- call 5+ business days ahead)
- **Blood pressure clinics**
- **Social and educational programs**
- **Meeting space** for non-profit organizations
- **Monthly trips** for shopping and amusement (Tucson museums, Kitt Peak Observatory, etc.)

**Campaign Relevance:** Friends in Deed exemplifies the community's self-reliance ethos. Residents take care of each other because there is no city government to provide social services. A candidate who understands and respects this volunteer culture -- while advocating for more state/federal support -- will resonate. This is the kind of organization a candidate should physically volunteer with to demonstrate community commitment.

### 5.3 Green Valley News & Sahuarita Sun

**Website:** https://gvnews.com
**Type:** Local newspaper (print + digital)
**Publisher:** Wick Communications (third-generation family-owned community media company)
**Description:** "Your Voice. Your News. Your Community."
**Digital Community Platform:** NABUR by Green Valley News (gvnews.nabur.org) -- local online discussion forum

The paper covers:
- Local breaking news
- Lifestyle features
- Obituaries (significant readership in a retirement community)
- Community events
- Opinions/editorials/letters to editor
- Sports (limited local coverage)
- Real estate
- Business openings/closures

**Also publishes:** Sahuarita Sun (covering the adjacent Town of Sahuarita)

**Campaign Relevance:** Letters to the editor and earned media coverage in the Green Valley News are essential for reaching GV voters. Many residents still rely on print media. A candidate should cultivate a relationship with the editorial board. The NABUR online community platform is an emerging digital engagement channel for the community.

### 5.4 Valley Assistance Services (VAS)

**Website:** https://valleyassistanceservices.org
**Type:** Nonprofit social services agency
**Location:** 3950 S Camino del Heroe, Green Valley, AZ 85614
**Phone:** (520) 625-5966
**Serves:** ~7,000 people annually
**Rating:** 3/4 Stars on Charity Navigator

Valley Assistance Services has served families and seniors for almost 50 years. Programs include:

**Safety:** Community resources, Volunteers to Help in Your Home, SHiM (Fall Prevention Program)
**Finance:** Rental assistance, financial education, workforce training, savings programs
**Health:** A Touch That Cares (RN Medical Advocacy), Going Home with Care, Virtual Dementia Tour
**Transportation:** Neighbors Helping Neighbors -- trained volunteers provide rides to medical appointments, grocery shopping, essential errands

**Service area:** Sahuarita, Green Valley, Amado, Tubac, Carmen, Tumacacori, and Arivaca.

**IMPORTANT NOTE (2026):** VAS has had to pivot programs after **major federal funding cuts**. This is a politically relevant development -- a candidate can point to the real-world impact of federal budget decisions on local senior services.

### 5.5 Country Fair White Elephant

**Website:** https://gvwhiteelephant.com
**Type:** Nonprofit thrift store and charitable organization
**Location:** 601 N. La Canada, Green Valley
**Phone:** (520) 625-4119
**Founded:** 1964 (formally incorporated as Country Fair White Elephant Inc. in 1993)
**Volunteers:** **600+** (~100/day), working minimum 4 hours/week

The White Elephant is one of the most remarkable volunteer organizations in Arizona:
- **$38 million+ donated to local nonprofits, schools, fire departments, and organizations** over 60 years
- Recently distributed **$1.76 million** in a single grant cycle
- Beneficiaries include public/private schools, youth organizations, disease research, community arts, nature preservation, and rural fire departments
- This is effectively Green Valley's self-funded philanthropic engine

**Campaign Relevance:** The White Elephant is a beloved institution. 600+ volunteers means it touches nearly every social network in the community. A candidate should visit, shop, and reference it as an example of Green Valley's extraordinary volunteer spirit.

### 5.6 Green Valley/Sahuarita Chamber of Commerce

**Website:** https://greenvalleysahuarita.com
Serves as the business advocacy and promotion organization for the area. Provides:
- Business directory
- Visitor center (with walk-in tourism information)
- Networking events
- Economic development advocacy

### 5.7 Titan Missile Museum

**Location:** Green Valley (Duval Mine Road)
**Type:** National Historic Landmark
**Significance:** The last of 54 Titan II missile sites that were on alert across the US from 1963-1987. Only preserved Titan II ICBM silo in the world. Operated by the Arizona Aerospace Foundation.

**Visitor Experience:** 45-minute guided underground tours start every hour on the hour (10am-4pm). Visitors see three-ton blast doors, eight-foot-thick silo walls, and an actual 104-foot Titan II missile standing "on alert" in the launch duct. A powerful Cold War heritage experience.

**Campaign Relevance:** Perfect venue for national security/veteran messaging events. The museum draws visitors from across the country and is a point of community pride, especially among the veteran population.

### 5.8 Faith Communities

Green Valley has a robust church community serving its retirement population:

**Catholic:**
- Our Lady of The Valley Catholic Church (505 N. La Canada Dr)

**Protestant (Mainline):**

## 6. CAMPAIGN STRATEGY IMPLICATIONS

### 6.1 Voter Profile Summary

Green Valley voters are predominantly:
- White, elderly, well-educated retirees
- Military veterans and their spouses (significant minority)
- Fixed-income households dependent on Social Security/pensions
- Homeowners with high property equity but limited cash flow
- Politically engaged (high voter turnout is typical in retirement communities)
- Generally conservative but pragmatic on pocketbook issues
- Concerned about healthcare access, water security, and cost of living

### 6.2 Winning Messages for Green Valley

1. **Social Security and Medicare Protection** -- This is the #1 issue. 83.7% of households receive Social Security. "I will never vote to cut or privatize Social Security or Medicare."
2. **Hospital Restoration** -- NEW #2 ISSUE. "A private equity company took millions in federal pandemic money, then closed your only hospital. I'll fight for state action to restore hospital services to Green Valley."
3. **Water Security** -- "Mining companies are draining your aquifer at 5 feet per year while a sulfate plume spreads toward your homes. I will fight for fair water allocation and accelerated CAP pipeline funding."
4. **Property Tax Fairness** -- "You pay county taxes but get fewer services. Your home values are rising 6.5% a year, pushing up tax bills on fixed incomes. I'll advocate for senior property tax relief."
5. **Veteran Services** -- "One in four of your neighbors served this country. Our veterans deserve better than a 40-minute drive to the VA hospital."
6. **Cost of Living** -- "When poverty among Green Valley seniors has tripled in two decades, something is broken. I'll fight for prescription drug price reforms and utility rate protections."
7. **Senior Transportation** -- "When you can't drive yourself to a specialist 45 minutes away, you need someone fighting for better transit options."

### 6.3 Access Strategy

| Venue/Channel | Approach |
|---------------|----------|
| Green Valley Council | Request speaking slot at community forum; attend GVC events |
| GVR Recreation Centers | Hold town halls at GVR facilities (14 locations!) |
| HOA Board Meetings | Request time to address individual HOA boards |
| Green Valley News | Write op-eds, attend editorial board, earn coverage |

### 6.4 Canvassing Notes

- **Door-to-door viability:** Excellent. Subdivision layouts with clear streets, numbered homes, and walkable neighborhoods make canvassing efficient.
- **Best times:** Mid-morning (9-11am) or late afternoon (3-5pm). Avoid mid-day heat.
- **Seasonal consideration:** Many residents are **snowbirds** (seasonal, October-April). Canvass during peak season (January-March) for maximum contact.
- **Accessibility:** Be prepared for residents with mobility issues answering doors slowly; be patient and respectful.
- **Security concerns:** Many HOAs have gate access or neighborhood watch; coordinate with HOA boards for entry permission.
