**"Workers Getting Their Dues"**

Levario Ramirez — Third-generation Arizona copper. Running for Arizona State House, Legislative District 19.

## The District

2. **Mine to Wire & Chip Act** — Keep value-add jobs in mining country
3. **Worker Privacy & Safety Act** — Protect the people who do the work
4. **Rural Healthcare Access Act** — A hospital in Greenlee County
5. **Arizona Education Equity Act** — Fund rural schools fairly
6. **Worker Housing Freedom Act** — End company town feudalism
