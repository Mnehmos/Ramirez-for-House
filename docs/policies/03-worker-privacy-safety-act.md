# Bill 3: Worker Privacy & Safety Act

**Theme:** Workers (Friday)
**Color:** #F44336 (Red)
**Shirt:** "LEGAL ON FRIDAY. FIRED ON MONDAY. WHY?"

## The Problem

Arizona legalized recreational cannabis in 2020 (Prop 207). Workplace drug testing laws never changed.

Workers can legally purchase cannabis on Friday and be fired for a positive drug test on Monday — for a substance that is legal, that they used on their own time, that did not impair their work performance.

### The Trap

- Cannabis stays detectable in urine for 3-30 days after use
- A positive test doesn't prove impairment — only past exposure
- Arizona's at-will employment means employers can fire for any legal reason, including off-duty cannabis use
- Mining, construction, and transportation workers are most affected — the exact working-class jobs that make LD-19 run

### The Safety Contradiction

- Current drug testing doesn't measure impairment
- A worker who used cannabis 2 weeks ago tests positive. A worker who had 8 beers last night tests negative.
- The system doesn't protect safety. It punishes legal behavior.

## The Bill

**Arizona Worker Privacy & Safety Act**

1. **Off-Duty Protection** — Employers cannot discipline employees for legal off-duty cannabis use, unless the employee works in a federally regulated safety-sensitive position
2. **Impairment-Based Testing** — Replaces metabolite testing (which detects past use) with impairment-based assessment for workplace safety
3. **Worker Voice in Safety** — Requires mining operations to establish elected worker safety committees with binding authority on safety protocols
4. **Whistleblower Protection** — Protects workers who report safety violations from retaliation

### Part B: Worker Voice in Safety

This is about restoring what workers lost when the unions were broken in 1983.

- Elected safety committees (not company-appointed)
- Binding authority on safety protocols
- Right to halt operations for imminent danger without retaliation
- Quarterly public safety reporting

## The Numbers

- Arizona cannabis tax revenue (2023): $300+ million
- Estimated workers affected by cannabis testing in LD-19: thousands (mining, construction, agriculture)
- Morenci mine safety: 6 years of operator experience (Ramirez) with perfect safety record — safety comes from training and culture, not urine tests

## Talking Points

- "The state legalized it. The state taxes it. But the state lets your boss fire you for it. Pick one."
- "Drug tests don't measure impairment. They measure what you did on your own time two weeks ago."
- "I ran heavy equipment for six years with a perfect safety record. Safety comes from training, culture, and accountability — not pee cups."
- "Workers should have a voice in their own safety. Not a suggestion box — a vote."
