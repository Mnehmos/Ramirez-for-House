## The Problem

In Morenci, if you lose your job, you lose your home. Company-owned housing means your employer is also your landlord.

This is a feudal arrangement that predates labor law. It persists because no one has challenged it.

### The History

Company towns were standard in early 20th century mining. Workers were paid in company scrip, lived in company housing, shopped at the company store. The union movement fought to end these practices.

In Morenci, the unions were broken in 1983-86. Some company town dynamics returned.

### The Reality Today

- Freeport-McMoRan owns significant housing stock in the Morenci area
- Employment termination can mean eviction
- Workers face a choice: accept any working condition, or lose both income and housing simultaneously
- This creates a power imbalance that undermines every other worker protection

## The Bill

**Arizona Worker Housing Freedom Act**

1. **Separation of Employment and Housing** — Employer-provided housing tenancy cannot be terminated solely due to employment termination. Minimum 90-day transition period.
2. **Fair Market Option** — Workers in employer housing must be offered the option to rent or purchase at fair market value, independent of employment status
3. **Housing Diversity Incentives** — Tax incentives for non-employer housing development in communities where >30% of housing stock is employer-owned
4. **Disclosure Requirements** — Employers must disclose housing-employment linkage at time of hire

## The Connection

You can't have worker freedom if losing your job means losing your home. Every other right — to organize, to report safety violations, to speak up — is undermined when your housing depends on your employer's goodwill.

## Talking Points

- "If your boss is also your landlord, how free are you really?"
- "Lose your job, lose your home. That's not employment — that's feudalism."
- "Workers can't stand up for their rights if standing up means their family is on the street."
- "We ended company scrip. We can end company housing coercion."
