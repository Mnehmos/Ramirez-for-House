# Bill 5: Arizona Education Equity Act

**Theme:** Education (Thursday)
**Color:** #FF9800 (Amber/Orange)
**Shirt:** "WHY CAN'T RURAL SCHOOLS RECRUIT TEACHERS?"

## The Problem

Rural Arizona schools can't compete for teachers. The funding formula doesn't account for rural costs. Kids in Graham County get a worse education than kids in Scottsdale — not because they're less capable, but because Phoenix doesn't fund rural schools fairly.

### Personal

I dropped out of Safford High. Not because it was hard. Because my physics teacher was actually the biology teacher, and he couldn't answer basic questions.

I went to Eastern Arizona College, earned 120 credits, and was named Engineering Student of the Year 2022.

The system failed me. I routed around it. Not every kid can do that.

### The Numbers

- Rural teacher vacancies go unfilled for years
- No housing assistance for teachers in small towns
- Funding formulas don't account for rural costs (transportation, facility maintenance, smaller class pools)
- Teacher pay in Graham County vs. Maricopa County: significant gap

## The Bill

**Arizona Education Equity Act**

1. **Fix the Funding Formula** — Rural students cost more to educate. The formula should reflect that.
2. **Rural Teacher Recruitment Fund** — Housing assistance, loan forgiveness, signing bonuses for teachers who commit to rural districts for 3+ years
3. **Dual Enrollment Expansion** — Expand partnerships between rural high schools and community colleges (especially EAC)
4. **Vacancy Reporting** — Requires state reporting on teacher vacancies by district, with corrective action triggers

## The Connection

Eastern Arizona College saved my trajectory. It should be the start, not the backup plan.

Every kid in LD-19 deserves a physics teacher who can actually teach physics.

## Talking Points

- "I dropped out of Safford High. EAC gave me a second chance. Not every kid gets a second chance."
- "Rural schools can't recruit because we don't pay enough and we don't help with housing. Those are solvable problems."
- "Kids in Graham County are just as smart as kids in Scottsdale. They just don't get the same resources."
- "Eastern Arizona College is one of the best-kept secrets in this state. Let's make it the pipeline, not the safety net."
