## The Problem

Greenlee County has no hospital. The nearest ER is in Safford (Graham County) — 40+ minutes from Morenci.

For a community built around one of the most dangerous industries in America, this is unconscionable.

### The Reality

- Rural hospital closures have accelerated across Arizona
- Green Valley (median age 73.3) — retirees dependent on healthcare access
- Graham County poverty rate: 17.7%
- Greenlee County: 90% mining GDP but can't sustain a hospital
- Mining injuries require immediate trauma care — 40 minutes is the difference between recovery and permanent disability

## The Bill

**Arizona Rural Healthcare Access Act**

1. **Critical Access Hospital Funding** — State matching funds for rural hospital construction and operation in counties with >50% extraction industry GDP
2. **Telehealth Expansion** — Broadband infrastructure grants for rural healthcare facilities
3. **Provider Recruitment** — Loan forgiveness and housing assistance for healthcare workers who serve in rural Arizona for 3+ years
4. **Emergency Response** — Requires mining operations above 500 employees to maintain on-site emergency medical facilities

## The Connection to Mining

Freeport-McMoRan profits $1.9 billion. Greenlee County — where they extract most of that value — can't keep a hospital open.

The Mining Community Investment Act (Bill 2) generates the revenue. This bill directs part of it to healthcare.

## Talking Points

- "Greenlee County produces billions in copper. It can't keep a hospital open. Something is broken."
- "If you get hurt in the pit at Morenci, the nearest ER is 40 minutes away. That's not healthcare — that's a gamble."
- "Green Valley: median age 73. 68% rely on retirement income. They moved here for the quality of life. They're losing access to the care that keeps them alive."
