## The Problem

Arizona's groundwater management laws were written to protect urban areas. Rural communities — especially mining communities — have no equivalent protection.

- In Green Valley, the water table is dropping because ASARCO-Mission Mine, Freeport-McMoRan Sierrita Mine, and Farmers Investment Co. are industrial-scale water users pumping from the same aquifer as residents
- Greenlee County residents share groundwater with the largest copper mine in North America
- No state law requires mines to prioritize residential water access over industrial extraction
- Wells go dry. Families drill deeper. The cost falls on homeowners.

## The Bill

**Arizona Family Well Protection Act**

What it does:

1. **Residential Priority** — Establishes legal priority for residential wells within 5 miles of industrial extraction operations
2. **Monitoring & Disclosure** — Requires industrial water users above 100 acre-feet/year to report water table impacts quarterly
3. **Compensation Fund** — Creates a fund (funded by industrial water users) to cover well-deepening costs when residential wells are impacted by industrial drawdown
4. **Impact Assessment** — Requires water impact assessment before new industrial extraction permits are issued in areas with residential wells

## The Numbers

- Average cost to deepen a residential well: $15,000-$30,000
- Freeport-McMoRan water usage at Morenci: ~70,000 acre-feet/year
- Number of residential wells within 10 miles of LD-19 mining operations: estimated 2,000+

## Why This Matters for LD-19

Every community in this district has a water story. Green Valley retirees watching their water table drop. Safford families competing with the Lone Star mine. Willcox agricultural water disputes.

Water is the one issue that crosses every political line in southern Arizona.

## Talking Points

- "Your family shouldn't have to choose between a working well and a mining company's quarterly report"
- "We're not anti-mining. We're pro-family. Mines can operate and families can have water — if someone writes the rules."
- "Green Valley: median age 73. These are retirees watching their wells go dry. That's not a political issue — it's a moral one."
