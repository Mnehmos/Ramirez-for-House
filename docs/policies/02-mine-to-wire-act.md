## The Problem

Arizona produces copper. It doesn't process copper.

Morenci and Safford/Lone Star produce copper cathode — 99.99% pure copper. That cathode is shipped out of state to be turned into wire, cable, rod, and components. The value-add manufacturing happens elsewhere. The jobs, tax revenue, and economic multiplier leave with it.

### The Extraction Math

- **Greenlee County GDP:** 90% from mining
- **Greenlee County poverty rate:** 17.7% (47% above national average)
- **Graham County per capita income:** Ranks 15th of 15 Arizona counties
- **Combined copper value extracted:** $4+ billion/year
- **What stays locally:** ~$285 million (wages, taxes, purchases)

That's 6-7 cents on the dollar.

### Freeport-McMoRan Financials (2023)

- **Revenue:** $22.9 billion ($5.4B North America copper)
- **Net income:** $1.9 billion
- **CEO compensation:** ~$23.9 million
- **Profit per U.S. worker:** ~$48,717 (goes to shareholders, not workers)
- **Current AZ severance tax:** 2.5%

## The Bill

**Arizona Mine to Wire & Chip Act**

Two parts:

### Part A: Mining Community Investment Act

Raises Arizona's mining severance tax from 2.5% to 5%.

- On $5.4B North America copper revenue:
  - Current tax: ~$135 million
  - Proposed: ~$270 million
  - **Additional for Arizona communities: $135 million/year**
- Revenue directed to: schools, roads, healthcare infrastructure, economic diversification in extraction counties
- Still leaves Arizona **below** Montana, New Mexico, and Nevada severance tax rates

### Part B: Value-Add Manufacturing Incentives

- Tax incentives for copper rod mills, wire drawing, and component manufacturing within 50 miles of extraction sites
- Workforce training partnerships with Eastern Arizona College
- Infrastructure grants for industrial sites with existing rail/power access

## The Model: Southwire (Georgia)

Southwire built a $100M copper rod mill in Carrollton, Georgia — a town that has to **import** cathode. We **produce** cathode. The economics favor local processing when someone creates the right conditions.

## FAQ

**Won't higher severance taxes drive mining companies away?**
No. Arizona's geology, existing infrastructure, and skilled workforce make us competitive even at higher rates. Freeport operates globally in jurisdictions with higher tax burdens. A 2.5 percentage point increase still leaves Arizona below Montana, New Mexico, and Nevada.

**Why hasn't this happened already?**
Because mining companies prefer to capture downstream value themselves — elsewhere. And because Arizona's political leadership has prioritized corporate interests over community prosperity.

**Can Graham County really attract wire manufacturing?**
Yes. The raw material is here. The workforce is here. The rail access exists. What's missing is political will.

## Talking Points

- "Greenlee County: 90% mining GDP, 17.7% poverty. That's not an economy — that's extraction."
- "We produce the copper that wires America. We deserve more than 6 cents on the dollar."
- "I'm not anti-Freeport. I'm pro-Graham County. Those should be the same thing."
- "From extraction to finished product. Right here in Mining Country."

## The History

- Greenlee County voted Democratic from 1912 to 1996
- Phelps Dodge broke the union in 1983-86
- Brought in the National Guard, replaced workers with scabs
- Union membership dropped from 8.8% to 3.7%
- The politics followed the economics. When workers lost power, the community lost wealth.
