# LD-19 Opposition Research

## Current Representatives

### Gail Griffin (R) — Senate
- Long-serving Republican
- Mining-friendly voting record
- Water policy history favorable to industrial users

### David Gowan (R) — Former
- "Gail Griffin and David Gowan territory"

### 2024 House Results
- **Griffin (R):** 31,444 votes (39.6%)
- **Diaz (R):** 29,143 votes (36.7%)
- **Frostrom Jr. (D):** 18,506 votes (23.3%)

## Key Vulnerabilities

1. **Extraction without reinvestment** — Incumbents have allowed $4B+ annual extraction with 6-7 cents staying local
2. **Water policy** — No action on residential well protection
3. **Healthcare** — Greenlee County still has no hospital
4. **Education** — Rural teacher shortages persist
5. **Housing** — Company town dynamics unchanged
6. **Environmental** — $6.8M Freeport settlement happened on their watch

## The Uncontested Race Problem

If no Democrat files, Republicans run uncontested. This:
- Demoralizes future progressive candidates
- Tells progressive-leaning LD-19 residents nobody's fighting for them
- Lets incumbents claim community representation without defending it
- Reinforces "this is their territory" narrative

## Strategic Framing

- Not running *against* Republicans. Running *for* workers.
- Don't culture war. Economics only.
- "Ask me what you think democratic socialism means" — disarming, not threatening
- Mamdani model: be present, be credible, be specific
