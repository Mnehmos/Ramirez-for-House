    <h2>The Pitch</h2>
    <p>
      I'm Levario Ramirez. I grew up in Hayden &mdash; a smelter town where the soil had to be excavated because of contamination. A town that's lost 75% of its population. I've lived in Safford for 20 years.
    </p>
    <p>
      I ran heavy equipment at Freeport-McMoRan's Morenci mine for six years. Perfect safety record. I know what it means to do the work that builds this state.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm running because the people who produce Arizona's wealth deserve their share of it. Not a handout &mdash; their <em>share</em>. We dig the copper, we grow the cotton, we teach the kids, and we deserve representation that fights for us instead of the shareholders.
    </p>

    <h2>Six Bills</h2>
    <p>
      Anyone can say they support workers or oppose poverty. That's meaningless without specifics. These bills are the specifics &mdash; what I would actually do in office.
    </p>

    <a href={`${base}water/`} class="bill-card">
      <span class="bill-tag" style="background: rgba(33, 150, 243, 0.2); color: #2196F3;">Bill 1 &middot; Water</span>
      <h3>Family Well Protection Act</h3>
      <p>Your water before their profits. Protect residential wells from industrial drawdown.</p>
      <ul class="bill-specifics">
        <li><strong>Residential priority</strong> for wells within 5 miles of industrial extraction</li>
        <li><strong>Quarterly monitoring</strong> &mdash; industrial users above 100 acre-feet/year must report water table impacts</li>
        <li><strong>Compensation fund</strong> paid by industrial users to cover well-deepening costs when residential wells go dry</li>
        <li><strong>Impact assessment</strong> required before new extraction permits are issued near residential wells</li>
      </ul>
    </a>

    <a href={`${base}copper/`} class="bill-card">
      <span class="bill-tag" style="background: rgba(184, 115, 51, 0.2); color: #B87333;">Bill 2 &middot; Copper</span>
      <h3>Mine to Wire &amp; Chip Act</h3>
      <p>$4 billion extracted, 6 cents stays. Keep value-add manufacturing in mining country.</p>
      <ul class="bill-specifics">
        <li><strong>Raise severance tax</strong> from 2.5% to 5% &mdash; still below Montana, New Mexico, and Nevada. Generates ~$135M/year for mining communities</li>
        <li><strong>Value-add manufacturing incentives</strong> &mdash; tax breaks for copper wire, rod, and component manufacturing built near extraction sites</li>
        <li><strong>Community investment fund</strong> from severance revenue for infrastructure, schools, and healthcare in extraction counties</li>
        <li><strong>The math:</strong> Freeport-McMoRan made $1.9B in profit. CEO made $23.9M. Profit per U.S. worker: $48,717 &mdash; sent to shareholders, not workers</li>
      </ul>
    </a>

    <a href={`${base}workers/`} class="bill-card">
      <span class="bill-tag" style="background: rgba(244, 67, 54, 0.2); color: #F44336;">Bill 3 &middot; Workers</span>
      <h3>Worker Privacy &amp; Safety Act</h3>
      <p>Legal on Friday, fired on Monday. Fix the cannabis testing contradiction. Restore worker safety voice.</p>
      <ul class="bill-specifics">
        <li><strong>Off-duty protection</strong> &mdash; employers cannot fire for legal cannabis use on personal time</li>
        <li><strong>Impairment-based testing</strong> replaces metabolite testing &mdash; test for actual impairment, not what someone did 3 weeks ago</li>
        <li><strong>Elected worker safety committees</strong> with binding authority to flag hazards and halt unsafe conditions</li>
        <li><strong>Whistleblower protection</strong> &mdash; workers who report safety violations cannot be retaliated against</li>
      </ul>
    </a>

    <a href={`${base}poverty/`} class="bill-card">
      <span class="bill-tag" style="background: rgba(76, 175, 80, 0.2); color: #4CAF50;">Bill 4 &middot; Healthcare</span>
      <h3>Rural Healthcare Access Act</h3>
      <p>Greenlee County has zero hospitals. The nearest ER is 40+ minutes from Morenci.</p>
      <ul class="bill-specifics">
        <li><strong>Critical access hospital funding</strong> &mdash; state matching funds for rural hospitals in counties with 50%+ extraction GDP</li>
        <li><strong>Telehealth expansion</strong> &mdash; broadband infrastructure grants for rural healthcare facilities</li>
        <li><strong>Provider recruitment</strong> &mdash; loan forgiveness and housing assistance for healthcare workers who serve 3+ years in rural Arizona</li>
        <li><strong>On-site emergency facilities</strong> required at mining operations with 500+ employees</li>
      </ul>
    </a>

    <a href={`${base}education/`} class="bill-card">
      <span class="bill-tag" style="background: rgba(255, 152, 0, 0.2); color: #FF9800;">Bill 5 &middot; Education</span>
      <h3>Arizona Education Equity Act</h3>
      <p>I dropped out of Safford High because my physics teacher was the biology teacher &mdash; and he couldn't answer my questions.</p>
      <ul class="bill-specifics">
        <li><strong>Fix the rural funding formula</strong> &mdash; account for transportation, facility costs, and smaller class pools</li>
        <li><strong>Rural Teacher Recruitment Fund</strong> &mdash; housing assistance and loan forgiveness to bring qualified teachers to small towns</li>
        <li><strong>Dual enrollment expansion</strong> with Eastern Arizona College &mdash; high schoolers earning college credit for free</li>
        <li><strong>Personal:</strong> I went on to earn 120 credits at EAC and was named Engineering Student of the Year 2022. The system failed me. Not every kid can route around it.</li>
      </ul>
    </a>

    <a href={`${base}history/`} class="bill-card">
      <span class="bill-tag" style="background: rgba(139, 69, 19, 0.2); color: #CD853F;">Bill 6 &middot; Housing</span>
      <h3>Worker Housing Freedom Act</h3>
      <p>In Morenci, lose your job and you lose your home. Company-town feudalism, still running in 2026.</p>
      <ul class="bill-specifics">
        <li><strong>Separate employment from housing</strong> &mdash; termination cannot trigger eviction. 90-day transition period guaranteed</li>
        <li><strong>Fair-market rent and purchase options</strong> &mdash; workers can buy at appraised value, not company-set prices</li>
        <li><strong>Tax incentives for non-employer housing</strong> in company towns to create real alternatives</li>
        <li><strong>The history:</strong> Unions were broken in Morenci 1983-86. Greenlee County voted Democratic from statehood (1912) to 1996, then flipped. Politics followed economics.</li>
      </ul>

    <h2>Still Skeptical?</h2>
    <p>Good. You should be. Politicians lie.</p>
    <p>
      Here's my offer: I'll be delivering DoorDash in Safford. I'll be at the county fair. I'll be knocking on your door. Ask me anything. Push back. Tell me I'm wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'd rather have an honest argument than a fake agreement.
