    <h2>The Pitch</h2>
    <p>
      I'm Levario Ramirez. I grew up in Hayden-Winkelman &mdash; a smelter town where the soil had to be excavated because of contamination. A town that's lost 75% of its population.
    </p>
    <p>
      I ran heavy equipment at Freeport-McMoRan's Morenci mine for six years. Perfect safety record. I know what it means to do the work that builds this state.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm running because the people who produce Arizona's wealth deserve their share of it. Not a handout &mdash; their <em>share</em>. We dig the copper, we grow the cotton, we teach the kids, and we deserve representation that fights for us instead of the shareholders.
    </p>

    <h2>Six Bills</h2>
    <p>
      Anyone can say they support workers or oppose poverty. That's meaningless without specifics. These bills are the specifics &mdash; what I would actually do in office.

    <h2>Still Skeptical?</h2>
    <p>Good. You should be. Politicians lie.</p>
    <p>
      Here's my offer: I'll be delivering DoorDash in Safford. I'll be at the county fair. I'll be knocking on your door. Ask me anything. Push back. Tell me I'm wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'd rather have an honest argument than a fake agreement.
