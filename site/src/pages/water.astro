    <h1>Your Well or Their Profit?</h1>

    <p>
      Arizona's groundwater management laws were written to protect urban areas. Rural communities &mdash; especially mining communities &mdash; have no equivalent protection.

    <h2>The Problem</h2>
    <p>
      In Green Valley, the water table is dropping because ASARCO-Mission Mine, Freeport-McMoRan Sierrita Mine, and Farmers Investment Co. are industrial-scale water users pumping from the same aquifer as residents.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Greenlee County, residents share groundwater with the largest copper mine in North America. No state law requires mines to prioritize residential water access over industrial extraction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wells go dry. Families drill deeper. The cost falls on homeowners.
    </p>

    <h2>The Bill</h2>
    <p>
      The <strong>Arizona Family Well Protection Act</strong> establishes residential priority for wells near industrial extraction, requires quarterly water table monitoring and disclosure from major industrial users, creates a compensation fund for well-deepening costs, and requires water impact assessments before new industrial extraction permits.
    </p>

    <h2>Why It Matters in LD-19</h2>
    <p>
      Every community in this district has a water story. Green Valley retirees watching their water table drop. Safford families competing with the Lone Star mine. Willcox agricultural water disputes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Water is the one issue that crosses every political line in southern Arizona.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      "Green Valley: median age 73. These are retirees watching their wells go dry. That's not a political issue &mdash; it's a moral one."
