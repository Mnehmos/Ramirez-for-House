    <h1>Ask Me What You Think Democratic Socialism Means</h1>

    <p>
      Go ahead. I'll wait.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most people's first answer involves Venezuela, or the Soviet Union, or government-run everything. That's not what this is.
    </p>

    <h2>What It Actually Means</h2>
    <p>
      Democratic socialism means the people who produce the wealth should have a democratic say in how it's distributed. That's it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Right now, Freeport-McMoRan extracts $4+ billion in copper from Arizona every year. The decision about where that wealth goes is made by a board of directors in Phoenix. Greenlee County &mdash; where the copper comes from &mdash; has a 17.7% poverty rate.
    </p>
    <p>
      We think the communities that produce that wealth should have a voice in how it's shared. Not through revolution &mdash; through elections, legislation, and democratic accountability.
    </p>

    <h2>What We're NOT</h2>
    <p>
      We're not communists. We don't want to nationalize the mines. We don't want to abolish private property. We don't want a one-party state.
    </p>
    <p>
      We want to win elections. Pass bills. Prove that working-class politics works. And if we're wrong? Vote us out. That's the whole point of the "democratic" part.
    </p>

    <h2>What We DO Want</h2>
    <p>
      A fair severance tax so mining communities keep more than 6 cents on the dollar. Worker safety committees with real power. Healthcare access in rural counties. Schools that can recruit qualified teachers. Housing that isn't tied to your employer.
    </p>
    <p>
      That's the platform. Six bills. All of them readable. All of them debatable. None of them require a revolution.
    </p>

    <h2>The Real Question</h2>
    <p>
      The real question isn't whether you agree with the label. It's whether you agree with the bills.
    </p>
    <p>
      Read them. If you like the policies but hate the word "socialism" &mdash; fine. Vote for the policies. I'd rather have a voter who disagrees with my label but supports my legislation than a supporter who can't name a single bill.
    </p>
