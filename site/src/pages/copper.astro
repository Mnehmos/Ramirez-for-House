    <h1>We Produce the Wealth. We Deserve Our Share.</h1>

    <p>
      Arizona produces copper. It doesn't process copper. Morenci and Safford produce 99.99% pure copper cathode &mdash; then ship it out of state to become wire, cable, rod, and components. The value-add jobs leave with it.

    <h2>The Extraction Math</h2>
    <p>
      Freeport-McMoRan made $22.9 billion in revenue in 2023. $1.9 billion in net income. Their CEO earned $23.9 million. Greenlee County &mdash; where they extract most of that value &mdash; has a 17.7% poverty rate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of every dollar of copper pulled from Arizona soil, about 6-7 cents stays in the community. The rest goes to shareholders in Phoenix and New York.
    </p>

    <h2>The Bill</h2>
    <p>
      The <strong>Mine to Wire &amp; Chip Act</strong> has two parts. First, the Mining Community Investment Act raises Arizona's mining severance tax from 2.5% to 5% &mdash; generating an additional $135 million per year for extraction counties. That money goes to schools, roads, healthcare, and economic diversification.
    </p>
    <p>
      Second, value-add manufacturing incentives create tax breaks for copper rod mills, wire drawing, and component manufacturing within 50 miles of extraction sites, plus workforce training partnerships with Eastern Arizona College.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even at 5%, Arizona remains <strong>below</strong> Montana, New Mexico, and Nevada's severance tax rates.
    </p>

    <h2>The Model</h2>
    <p>
      Southwire built a $100 million copper rod mill in Carrollton, Georgia &mdash; a town that has to <em>import</em> cathode. We <em>produce</em> cathode. The economics favor local processing when someone creates the right conditions.
    </p>

    <h2>The History</h2>
    <p>
      Greenlee County voted Democratic from 1912 to 1996. Then Phelps Dodge broke the union in 1983-86 &mdash; brought in the National Guard, replaced workers with scabs. Union membership dropped from 8.8% to 3.7%.
    </p>
    <p>
      The politics followed the economics. When workers lost power, the community lost wealth.
