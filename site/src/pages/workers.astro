    <h1>Legal on Friday. Fired on Monday. Why?</h1>

    <p>
      Arizona legalized recreational cannabis in 2020. Workplace drug testing laws never changed. Workers can legally purchase cannabis on Friday and be fired for a positive drug test on Monday &mdash; for a substance that is legal, that they used on their own time, that did not impair their work performance.
    </p>

    <h2>The Trap</h2>
    <p>
      Cannabis stays detectable in urine for 3-30 days after use. A positive test doesn't prove impairment &mdash; only past exposure. A worker who used cannabis two weeks ago tests positive. A worker who had eight beers last night tests negative.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mining, construction, and transportation workers are most affected &mdash; the exact working-class jobs that make LD-19 run.
    </p>

    <h2>The Bill</h2>
    <p>
      The <strong>Worker Privacy &amp; Safety Act</strong> protects employees from discipline for legal off-duty cannabis use (except federally regulated safety-sensitive positions), replaces metabolite testing with impairment-based assessment, establishes elected worker safety committees with binding authority in mining operations, and protects whistleblowers who report safety violations.
    </p>

    <h2>Worker Voice in Safety</h2>
    <p>
      This is about restoring what workers lost when the unions were broken in 1983. Elected safety committees &mdash; not company-appointed ones. Binding authority on safety protocols. The right to halt operations for imminent danger without retaliation. Quarterly public safety reporting.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      "I ran heavy equipment for six years with a perfect safety record. Safety comes from training, culture, and accountability &mdash; not pee cups."
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      "The state legalized it. The state taxes it. But the state lets your boss fire you for it. Pick one."
